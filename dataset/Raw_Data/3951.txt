( PTI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 MUMBAI : Sachin Tendulkar does n't seem to be in a mood to give up on his innovative idea of having 15-a-side games at the inter-school and collegiate level despite the Mumbai Cricket Association ( MCA ) having rejected it . TOI has learnt that Tendulkar , in a bid to make his idea see the light of the day , recently requested MCA president and NCP supremo Sharad Pawar to ask the association have another serious look on the concept . Currently busy with the Maharashtra assembly elections , Pawar has now called a Managing Committee ( MC ) meeting of the MCA on October 16 , just a day after the polls will be conducted , to discuss the matter . The novel idea , it has emerged , was rejected twice by the managing committee , and did n't find favour with the MCA 's technical committee as well . Justifying his panel 's call , a member of the technical committee said : " Cricket is a team game , not an individual sport. According to Tendulkar 's idea , every team can play up to 11 batsmen. With so many batsmen around , it is doubtful who amongst them would take the responsibility of carrying the team through.
