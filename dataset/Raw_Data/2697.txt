After reaching the semifinals in four straight years , Stars have failed to make a final appearance and stated recently that they were exploring coaching options with Shipperd 's contract having expired with the franchise , reports cricket.com.au . " I 've been coaching in India for the past seven years in the IPL and have watched the Big Bash League grow from afar. It 's a great opportunity to work with another T20 side - the Stars are an exciting club and I 'm looking to develop my coaching through this opportunity as well , " Fleming said . " Hopefully it 's an opportunity for me to bring in some fresh ideas from the IPL and my time as a New Zealand cricketer. " The former left-handed opening batsman said he felt Stars are well positioned to build on their semifinal finishes from the first four seasons . " What I 'm looking to do is take my experiences from winning IPL and Champions League with Chennai and just try to create a calm sense that we can win the final - I do n't think there 's too much more to be done. " Fleming played 111 Test for New Zealand , captaining them in a record 80 matches. He will next visit Melbourne in March for the World Cup and will use that opportunity to meet with players , coaching staff , key stakeholders and the Board .
