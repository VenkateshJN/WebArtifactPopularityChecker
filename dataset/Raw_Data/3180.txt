World Cup 2015 : Yasir Shah should be in the team , says Rameez The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Mar 10 , 2015 , 08.07PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 KARACHI : Pakistan 's former captain Rameez Raja has urged the national team management to induct legspinner Yasir Shah for the remaining matches of the ongoing cricket World Cup . Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 Referring to the presence of experienced allrounder Shahid Afridi in the side , Rameez said in an interview that it was for the team management to decide whether to play two legspinners or just one specialist tweaker . " I just think it is about time Yasir Shah was included in the playing XI for the remaining matches. He is a talent and he is someone whom even a great like Shane Warne wanted to meet and talk with , " he said . " I just think Yasir should be in the team even if it means thinking about the option of not playing Afridi although I know it would be a very difficult decision for the management since he is such an experienced and regular feature of the one-day side , " he added . Pakistan played Yasir in their opening match of the World Cup against India but have since sidelined him . Rameez said it was no secret that it was not easy for the management to take strong and hard decisions . " I know it is not an easy situation but Yasir must play as he can be the x-factor , " he stated . Pace legend Wasim Akram said he wanted to see Umar Akmal play to his potential . " We all know he has loads of talent but it is time he delivered scores accordingly. His complaints about not being able to bat higher up the order do n't make sense now because even if he comes at number five or six it is his job to score runs.
