Mumbai lacked consistency , says Wright Gaurav Gupta Gaurav Gupta,TNN | May 30 , 2014 , 08.46 AM IST READ MORE Mumbai Indians | Lendl Simmons | John Wright | IPL | Chennai Super Kings RELATED MUMBAI : They did a magnificent job of bouncing back and reaching the playoffs despite losing their first five matches on the trot in the UAE , but coach John Wright still seemed a disappointed man after the Mumbai Indians crashed out of the tournament , losing the ` Eliminator ' to Chennai Super Kings at the Brabourne Stadium on Wednesday night. Admitting that the team badly missed an ` impact bowler ' after Lankan ace Lasith Malinga 's departure , Wright felt that the horrid start hurt the team 's chances badly. " We have n't had the consistency that was needed , certainly not at the start . Lendl Simmons did a magnificent job after coming into the team. He really turned things around for us. We juggled things a little bit. But the trouble with such a start is that sometimes you question your combinations and sometimes it takes a little while to get that right , " Wright remarked . Having said that , the former India coach was still full of praise for his boys for the way the defending champs staged a comeback in the tournament , with the miraculous 190-run chase in 14.4 overs against the Rajasthan Royals last Sunday being the standout effort. " We fought very hard since we have been back in India and I ca n't fault the boys from the position we were in , " Wright said . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Mumbai Indians,Lendl Simmons,John Wright,IPL,Chennai Super Kings Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
