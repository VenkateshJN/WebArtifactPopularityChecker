The Proteas will wrap up their spot in the last eight with victory over the UAE amateurs who have lost all of their four games so far . Proteas skipper AB de Villiers said he was " not too unhappy " about batting first . " It 's a good opportunity for our batters to once again score runs and get into form and hopefully set up a big total for them to chase down , " he said . Seamer Vernon Philander returns from a hamstring injury , replacing Kyle Abbott in the attack , while Faf du Plessis missed out due to a back injury , giving Farhaan Behardien a game . UAE captain Mohammad Tauqir said he wanted to place early pressure on South Africa 's renowned batting line-up , which has made 400-plus runs twice during the tournament . " It looks to be good wicket and we 've got a couple of fast bowlers in our side so we want to bowl first and put them under pressure , " he said .
