Team India sings the collapso tune , yet again The author has posted comments on this article Partha Bhaduri , TNN | Dec 30 , 2014 , 11.33AM IST Australian paceman Mitchell Johnson celebrates dismissing Indian batsman Umesh Yadav on the fourth day of the third Test at the MCG in Melbourne. ( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 MELBOURNE : From six for 64 to seven for 56. That 's not a champion bowler 's figures but just two of the shock batting collapses India went from February to December in 2014 , a year in which they played zero home Tests. This rare absence of games in friendly conditions severely tested the technique and temperament of the batsmen , and in 10 Test matches India suffered shock collapses in as many as 13 innings. These collapses were so sudden and obvious that it cost the team the match on a number of occasions . The story was the same in India 's last Test of the year here , when the scintillating 262-run stand between Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane was followed by the loss of seven wickets for 56 runs. The remaining two wickets fell in the space of 15 balls on Monday . Umesh Yadav lasted two balls , undone by the bounce from Johnson , while Shami edged a fuller one to second slip. From 409-3 , India went to 465 all out. The last three wickets added three runs . The difference between the two sides in this series has been batting contributions from the lower order . The difference is stark : The average runs put together for the last five wickets in this series by Indian batsmen is 15.56 , while for Australia the corresponding figure is 60.30. Wickets 7-10 have 633 runs in the series for Australia so far , while India have added only 283 , all completed innings combined . India 's inability in large parts to stitch together meaningful partnerships all year , however , has n't been restricted to the tail alone. In the five-Test series in England , for example , India 's tail ( wickets 7-10 ) added 1117 runs , 276 more than England 's 841. Yet every Test in that series saw a batting collapse . Even before England in Auckland at the beginning of the year , they went from 1384 to 202 all out. In Nottingham they went from 1401 to 1846 , losing 544 at the top. Even at Lord 's , where they won , India were 862 and then 1457 in the first innings , losing 559. At the Rose Bowl , they went from 802 in the second innings to 178 all out , with 8 wickets falling for 98. In Manchester , India lost the first six wickets for 63. In the second innings , they went from 531 to 666 , losing 513. At the Oval , they lost 880. In the second innings , it was 6-0 to 94 all out . The collapses have been so thorough that a multitude of ideas from conditions , batting order , and form of the batsmen to even dressing-room rifts have been suggested as reasons . At the Gabba , Dhoni had said , " Today was quite different compared to some other games. Yes , we have had batting collapses in all the recent Test series we have played. Generally , how you address these situations is by telling the batsmen to bat as normally as possible , to not look at the scoreboard. You play according to the merit of the delivery. " However , that does n't explain the sheer frequency of these collapses throughout the year. Maybe the skipper 's inability to meaningfully contribute with the bat , and Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli 's poor form in England , are more pertinent reasons. Kohli has turned it around here but the collapse remains a constant feature . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
