Gritty Sarfraz responds to Pakistan 's SOS Ireland vs Pakistan , 42nd Match , Pool B Sun , Mar 15 2015 by CB Staff Sarfraz Ahmed has responded to Pakistan 's call for a stable opener . After watching four matches from the bench , Sarfraz Ahmed was thrown into the deep end by the Pakistan team management in a crunch game against South Africa. The wicketkeeper-batsman has been in form , and he used his opportunity to score 49 that gave Pakistan a score that turned out to be a winning one. Against Ireland in their last group game which turned out to be a knockout , Sarfraz held his nerve and took his team home with relative ease . It had been eight years since a Pakistan batsman scored an ODI century and Sarfraz 's sights were set firmly on the landmark. With Ahmed Shehzad he put up a strong 120-run stand to lay the platform , set up another partnership with Haris Sohail until he was run out and carried on with his captain Misbah-ul-Haq until he was out hit-wicket. The dismissals did n't seem to deter Sarfraz , who along with Umar Akmal took Pakistan closer . Sarfraz and Umar may have used up too many deliveries towards the end to ensure Sarfraz reached his hundred , but the batsman 's celebration upon reaching his maiden ODI century indicated he stayed in fine form leading up to the all-important clash against Australia . Sarfraz and Ahmed Shehzad 's opening partnership also gave Pakistan confidence ahead of the quarter-finals of facing up to a strong Australian fast bowling line-up with two assured opening batsmen at the crease .
