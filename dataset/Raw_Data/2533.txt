I probably played two years too long : Ricky Ponting The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Jun 7 , 2014 , 02.31PM IST Ponting retired after an illustrious career spanning 17 years. ( Getty Images ) Page 1 of 4 MELBOURNE : Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting , who retired in 2012 , has said he delayed his international retirement by two years in his bid to help the team deal with a generational shift . Ponting , who played in 168 Test matches for Australia , said he stayed on because he wanted to help the next generation of Australian Test stars to come through . " I probably played two years longer than I should have done , " he told Sky Sports . " I think I knew in myself that I could n't get better. I felt that if anything , I could maintain a certain level. I think from 120 , 130 Tests I knew I could not get any better , " the batting legend said candidly . One of the finest batsmen in contemporary cricket and Australia 's middle order bulwark for years retired after an illustrious career spanning 17 years . " I was n't playing for me , I was playing for the younger guys in the team. Great teams that I played in had a really good solid core of experienced players and great characters , " said the two-time World Cup-winning captain . " I might be patting myself on the back here , but I thought I was one of those players , " he said . Ponting gave up captaincy after the 2011 World Cup and then played under Michael Clarke . He suffered from a dip in form the last few years of his career and continued playing Test cricket despite being axed from Australia 's one-day squad .
