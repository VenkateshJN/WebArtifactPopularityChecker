Lord 's weathervane damaged due to high winds The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Mar 30 , 2015 , 05.17PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 LONDON : Lord 's Cricket Ground 's famous weathervane , Father Time , has been damaged during high winds in London over the weekend . It currently sits at almost 90 degrees to its original position . Staff from Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) , which owns Lord 's , are working with specialists to restore it to its original position as soon as possible , a release said . This is not the first time the weathervane has fallen foul of the elements : in 1992 it was struck by lightning and the subsequent repairs were featured on Blue Peter . Father Time was given to MCC in 1926 by the architect of the Lord 's Grand Stand , Sir Herbert Baker. During World War II , it was wrenched from its original perch when it became entangled in the steel cable of a barrage balloon . It was reattached to the top of the Grand Stand where it sat until 1996 when it was relocated to the Mound Stand . The symbolism of the figure derives from Law 16 ( 3 ) of the Laws of Cricket : " After the call of Time , the bails shall be removed from both wickets. " Father Time also 'tweets ' on behalf of Lord 's Cricket Ground via @ HomeofCricket . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
