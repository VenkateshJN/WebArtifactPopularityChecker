WC team preview : Scotland out to avoid 1999 , 2007 relapse New Delhi , Mon , Jan 19 2015 by Siddharth Vishwanathan Last updated on Tuesday , 20 January , 2015 , 11 : 19 AM Scotland featured in the 1999 and 2007 World Cup They have not won a World Cup match yet Scotland will be led by Preston Mommsen in the 2015 World Cup. © Getty Scotland have lived under England 's shadow and struggled to gain even a foothold. Their cricketing journey began in 1992 when they broke away from the TCCB ( Test and County Cricket Board ) as the England and Wales Cricket Board was then known. In 1994 , they became Associate members of the ICC and started off on a good note when they finished third in the ICC Trophy of 1997 , gaining qualification for the ICC World Cup in 1999 . The tournament proved to be a hard test for the Scots as they lost all matches in the first round. In 2007 , they were again winless. Scotland have secured qualification for the 2015 World Cup and will be aiming to put in a better performance . Group : Pool A Captain : Preston Mommsen Strengths Their batting has a mixture of youth and experience. Kyle Coetzer provides good value in the middle order with 718 runs ( average 39.88 ) . Richie Berrington , who became the first Scotland batsman to score a T20I century , can provide aggression at the top while allrounder Josh Davey , who scored an unbeaten 53 and picked up 6 for 28 against Afghanistan in Abu Dhabi , provides utility . Weakness The lack of experience of playing against major teams , let alone a major tournament , is a big hindrance. Scotland have mostly played one-off ODIs against Australia , England , Sri Lanka and Pakistan. They are also playing in a World Cup after eight years , thus their ability to cope with pressure will be limited . X-factor Berrington has contributed to a few Scotland successes. In a series against Ireland , he scored an unbeaten 101 off 126 balls to help Scotland bounce back , and in a T20I against Bangladesh at The Hague he smashed a century off 55 balls to give Scotland their only victory against a Test-playing nation. Clearly , Berrington can spur the team to victories . Dark horse With 49 ODIs under his belt , Majid Haq has plenty of experience. He is the leading wicket-taker in his team with 57 wickets ( average 31 ) and is the only bowler in the squad who has a five-for. Given the pitches in Australia have been slow and spin has played a part , his offspin will be of great value to the team . Recent form : ( last six months ) v Ireland : Lost 1-2 ( away ) v Afghanistan and Ireland in UAE ( ongoing series ) : Lost two , won one Past World Cup experience : Scotland 's only appearances in the World Cup were in 1999 in Britain and 2007 in the Caribbean. In 1999 , they lost to Australia by six wickets , Pakistan by 94 runs , Bangladesh by 22 runs in their first World Cup match at home in Edinburgh , were bowled out for a mere 68 by West Indies and 121 by New Zealand. Their critics said Scotland wasted the opportunity. In 2007 , they were crushed by Australia ( 203 runs ) , South Africa ( seven wickets ) and Netherlands ( eight wickets ) to exit at the first stage .
