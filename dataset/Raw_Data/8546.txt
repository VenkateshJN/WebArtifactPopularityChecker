It is an achievement to be proud of and a recognition for their good performances in the qualifying period . “ Team selection is one of the toughest jobs and when you have a large pool of outstanding players to select from in a 12-month period between 26 August 2013 and 17 September 2014 , then it becomes even more difficult . “ However , we think we have selected the best possible sides , which are well balanced and capable of beating any side on any given day in any given conditions. While selecting these squads , the selectors discussed various combinations and took into account several scenarios like opposition , pitch conditions and match situations. ” Kumble was joined on the panel by Jonathan Agnew , a former England international and now a respected broadcaster/journalist , ex-Sri Lanka opener Russel Arnold , former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming , and Betty Timmer , former Chair of the ICC Women ’ s Committee . Statistics were available as a guide but were not necessarily the overwhelming factor in the choices made .
