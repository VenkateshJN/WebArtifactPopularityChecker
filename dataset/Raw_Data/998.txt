( Also read : Azhar Ali appointed new captain of Pakistani ODI side ) During the World Cup , a viral marketing campaign titled 'Mauka Mauka ' had poked fun at Pakistani fans. The national cricket team 's rather dismal performance had not helped matters with the side losing to Australia in the quarters. Arch-rivals India had been in great form since beating Pakistan in their first Pool B match but eventually lost to the Aussies in the semis. On a Pakistani chat show , Afridi was asked how he reacted to India 's defeat and the 35-year-old reacted by singing the popular jingle. " I got a clip from Saudi that showed the 'Mauka ' ad after India lost , " clarified Afridi . Not just Afridi but fans and the media in Pakistan had found some solace in the fact that defending champions India could only fare slightly better than their team Down Under. While Pakistan had barely managed to enter the quarters , India had registered seven wins on the trot before losing to the semifinal. In the end though , hearts were left broken on both sides of the border as India and Pakistan had to book early return flights home.
