Riaz insists that he has not been influenced by Zaheer and that Wasim Akram is his guru , he does admit that he wants to take a leaf out Zak 's book. It 's Zaheer 's yorker with the new ball that Riaz wants to master in the days to come . " I have been told many times that I am similar to Zaheer in my bowling but I am not sure. But the yorker that Zaheer bhai bowls with the new ball is superb. I have been working on that and if I can get that ball to go , it will be great , " Riaz told TOI on Tuesday on the sidelines of Pakistan 's training session . Riaz has n't spoken to Zaheer about this delivery but would surely like to when he gets the chance. " Zaheer is a very good bowler and there 's lot to learn from him. I would surely like to take some bowling tips from him when I get the chance , " Riaz said . The paceman has clocked over 150 km/hr in the World Cup and has looked one of the better bowlers in the tournament. When asked about his pace and form , he said : " Pace has never been a factor with me. I have always bowled at 145 km/hr. In Brisbane , I got some bounce as well which can be crucial. " Riaz came into prominence in the last World Cup semifinal against India , when he took five wickets , albeit in a losing cause. The left-arm paceman says he wants to repeat performances like that in the games to come . " We had some great spinners like Saeed Ajmal and Mohammad Hafeez who are not there in the team anymore. It 's the pacers who have to step up now and I am hoping to do that. " Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
