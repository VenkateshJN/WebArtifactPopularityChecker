'Spooked ' hotel had England players in a tizzy The author has posted comments on this article TNN | Jul 21 , 2014 , 10.48AM IST Broad said several members of the side and their partners had endured difficulty sleeping at the five-star Langham Hotel in London. ( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 LONDON : England have often looked a haunted side during their ongoing run of nine Tests without a win . And according to pacer Stuart Broad they have a particular reason to be spooked during matches in London after ghostly goings-on at the team hotel . Broad said several members of the side and their partners had endured difficulty sleeping at the five-star Langham Hotel in central London , with some players changing rooms in order to get some rest . Although Broad said he had endured no unexplained disturbances while sleeping during the ongoing second Test against India at London 's Lord 's ground , that was n't the case when England played Sri Lanka at the 'home of cricket ' last month . " During the Sri Lanka Test I had to move rooms , " fast bowler Broad told a tabloid on Sunday . " One night I woke up in the middle of the night , around 1.30am and I was convinced there was a presence in the room. It was the weirdest feeling. I turned the light on and looked online and could see Matt Prior was online , too. I went to his room and he said exactly the same thing ! He was wide awake as well. Neither of us could sleep because we were so spooked out. Matt was in a twin room so I ended up sharing with him. " It is not the first time Test cricketers have been subjected to supposed paranormal activity . In 2005 , Shane Watson was spooked by the ghost said to haunt Durham 's Lumley Castle where the team were staying ahead of a match at the nearby Chester-le-Street ground in north-east England .
