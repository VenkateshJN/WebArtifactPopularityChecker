In a statement released by Pietersen , SRH , who had shelled out Rs 2 crore for the top-order batsman during the 2015 auction , agreed to release him after ECB chairman Colin Graves ' comments that Pietersen could be considered again , provided he commits to playing county cricket first . " The agreement allows Pietersen to miss the Sunrisers ' entire league fixtures , but will see him recalled should the team reach the knockout stages of the competition ( which commence on 19 May and finish with the final on 24 May ) , " read the statement . Pietersen , who was unceremoniously sacked from the England setup 14 months back , said in the statement that he is looking forward to the upcoming season and thanked the IPL franchise for their support . " I 'm hugely grateful for all the support and understanding I 've received from everyone at the Sunrisers and the IPL. My focus is now very much on the upcoming season in England and I 'm absolutely determined to score as many runs as possible . " I 've never made any secret of my overwhelming desire to once again represent England and I 'm going to do everything in my power to earn a recall to the international set-up . " To once again put on that England shirt would be a privilege and an honour , but now I have to focus on performing domestically and give myself the best possible chance of meriting selection.
