I was not supposed to contest , says Sharad Pawar The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Mar 2 , 2015 , 06.29PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 CHENNAI : Seasoned politician Sharad Pawar , who was forced to pull out of the race for president 's post at the BCCI elections , said on Monday the poll outcome has shown that the powerful cricketing body was not solely controlled by N Srinivasan . " I am quite happy with the new set of board members , " said Pawar after Jagmohan Dalmiya was unanimously elected president at the BCCI AGM on Monday . Asked about contesting in the elections , Pawar said : " I was not supposed to contest...according to constitution this was the time for someone from east ( zone ) side and someone has to contest from that belt only. " Srinivisan loyalist Sanjay Patel lost the post of secretary by one vote to BJP 's Anurag Thakur. Pawar said the result showed that Srinivasan did not rule the board . " Somebody was claiming that the entire board was under his thumb , so this result has shown that is not the situation , " said Pawar . However , not all is lost for Srinivasan as the AGM ratified his position as the ICC chairman , according to a top official . The development did not go down well with Aditya Verma , the petitioner in the IPL spot-fixing case . " We will file contempt case against the BCCI. How can they approve Srinivasan 's name for the ICC post before completion of justice Lodha committee findings ? " Hope under the leadership of the experienced Dalmiya ji , BCCI will do well. I also congratulate Anurag Thakur for his new innings , " said Verma . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
