Cricket A very nice App regarding live cricket score . User reviews Robert Pereira 20 March 2015 Not among the best. Takes forever to load. Goes to first innings repeatedly. Needs improvement. Work on it for a better rating . Arpit Jain 24 March 2015 Refresh Refreshing resets the view to first innings. Drop down to select innings is very clunky and laborious Suman Prasad 24 February 2015 Scorecard goes back to first inningd Stupid app. While watching 2nd innings scorecard it quickly and repeatedly refreshes to first innings. Very irritating. Pl fix quickly to increase rating .
