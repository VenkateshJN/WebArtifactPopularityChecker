Amitabh Bachchan to commentate in India-Pakistan World Cup clash The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Feb 3 , 2015 , 07.26PM IST Amitabh Bachchan is excited to commentate in the crucial contest between the arch-rivals on February 15. ( PTI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 NEW DELHI : Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan is set to make his commentary debut in the much-awaited India-Pakistan cricket World Cup game in Adelaide as part of a promotional activity for his upcoming film 'Shamitabh' . Amitabh , 72 , who is a self confessed cricket fan like millions in India , is excited to commentate in the crucial contest between the arch-rivals on February 15 , which falls a week after the R Balki-directed film releases worldwide on February 6 . Defending champions India have never lost to Pakistan in an ICC World Cup event but any clash between the two sides is a battle of nerves and Amitabh admits that his loyalties will stay intact in the commentary box . " It is going to be tough because you are a lover of the game and you want the best team to win. But because you are from India , you want India to win , obviously. So I am going to be pro India , " Amitabh said . " In the recent past I have been noticing that everytime I sit down in front of the TV to see game and India loses , so I have stopped watching a game. And when I do n't watch , they win. So probably I should not be commentating in this game , but these are very silly superstitions . " But yes I enjoy the game. I have seen many games in the past and many live games as well many many years ago. They have always been very interesting , " added the iconic actor .
