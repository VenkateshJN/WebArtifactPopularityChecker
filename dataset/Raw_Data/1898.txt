World Cup will be a great gift for Mahela , Sanga : Angelo The author has posted comments on this article Dwaipayan Datta , TNN | Feb 14 , 2015 , 09.56AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 CHRISTCHURCH : Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara have announced that they will retire from international cricket just after this tournament and the World Cup is the best farewell memento that their teammates can gift these two legends . " It 's obviously a big motivation for these two great servants of our cricket. They have done a lot for us and if we win , it will be a great gift for both Mahela and Sanga , " Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews said . While this is the fifth World Cup for the 38-year-old Jayawardene , his colleague Sangakkara , who is merely a few days younger , will be playing his fourth. Both have played two finals and a semifinal , but the ultimate prize has somehow slipped away . The fierce ambition to win the Cup is driving the duo and it could be sensed in the way they got down to business during practice on Friday. Both had long batting sessions and Mathews was right when he said their experience will make a world of difference to the campaign . " They have the wealth of experience. They know all about handling pressure and the knowledge that they bring to the table is invaluable , " Mathews said . The team management wants to ensure that all the team members learn how to deal with pressure situations from these two guys who have " been there , done that " . " It 's about reaching the two finals. They tell us how to deal with those situations so that we can once again put ourselves in a position to make that stage and go a step further , " the captain added .
