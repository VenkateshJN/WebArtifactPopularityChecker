TOI looks at the things that worked and that did n't for the teams . 1 MOUNT MAUNGANUI ( OCT 24 , 2014 ) : South won by 72 runs. SA 282/9 ( H Amla 119 , F du Plessis 67 , AB de Villiers 37 ) bt New Zealand 210 ( L Ronchi 79 , M McCleanaghan 34 * ) . STRONG TOP-ORDER SHOW : A formidable show by the top-order led by Hashim Amla ( 119 ) helped SA post a competitive 282. The bowlers then struck early on and reduced the Kiwis to 134 for nine before bowling them out for 210 . PACERS LET TEAM DOWN : New Zealands ' spearheads Trent Boult and Tim Southee proved expensive and that let the Proteas off the hook. Later , the batsmen made a mess of the chase. The only bright spot was the 74-run partnership for the last wicket between Luke Ronchi and M McClenaghan . 2 MOUNT MAUNGANUI ( OCT 21 , 2014 ) : South Africa won by six wickets. New Zealand 230 ( L Ronchi 99 ) lost to SA 2364 ( AB de Villiers 89 * , JP Duminy 58 * ) . BOWLERS DO THE TRICK : The South African bowlers reduced the Kiwis to 68 for five before restricting them to a modest 230. Despite a poor start , AB de Villiers and JP Duminy strung a 139-run stand for the fifth wicket to see the team through . SPINELESS BATTING : The Kiwis , barring Luke Ronchi ( 99 ) , failed to counter the SA bowlers. The bowlers took a couple of early wickets but then failed to rein in de Villiers and Duminy . 3 POTCHEFSTROOM ( JAN 25 , 2013 ) : South Africa won by one wicket. New Zealand 260/9 ( G Elliott 54 , C Munro 57 , J Franklin 53 * ; L Tsotsobe 445 , R McLaren 4/52 ) lost to SA 264/9 ( G Smith 116 ) . SMITH MAGIC : L Tsotsobe and Ryan McLaren led the South African attack as they restricted the Kiwis to 260. Opener Graeme Smith then struck a fine century to help the team post a one-wicket win in what turned out to be a tricky chase . SO NEAR , YET SO FAR : The middle-order stood well for the visitors after the top three fell cheaply. Defending a modest score , the bowlers put up a splendid show to almost pull off a win . 4 KIMBERLEY ( JAN 22 , 2013 ) : New Zealand won by 27 runs. New Zealand 279/8 ( K Williamson 145 * , G Elliott 48 ; M Morkel 371 ) bt SA 252 ( G Smith 66 , C Ingram 79 ) . POOR RUNNING : The bowlers let the Kiwis off the hook after having them on the rope and then poor running between the wickets cost SA the match. Graeme Smith and Colin Ingram struck half-centuries but five run outs did their cause no good . SPLENDID FIELDING EFFORT : Kane Williamson 's superb knock bailed the Kiwis out and then Nathan McCullum , Matin Guptill and James Franklin were superb on the field as they ran the rivals out . 5 PAARL ( JAN 19 , 2013 ) : New Zealand won by one wicket. South Africa 208 ( Faf du Plessis 57 , R McLaren 33 ; M McClenaghan 420 , K Williamson 4/22 ) lost to New Zealand 209/9 ( B Watling 45 , J Franklin 47 * ; R McLaren 446 ) . WIDE OFF THE TARGET : Faf du Plessis came good with a half-century after a poor start. The bowlers then had the Kiwis on the ropes but their waywardness cost them the game. 31 extras hurt their cause . LEFT IS RIGHT : Left arm seamer Mitchell McClenaghan and offie Kane Williamson came good with the ball. Later , Bruce Watling and James Franklin stuck together to took their side to victory .
