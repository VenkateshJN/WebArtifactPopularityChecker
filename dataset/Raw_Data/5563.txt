Cummins in doubt for Afghanistan clash Mon , Mar 02 2015 Last updated on Monday , 02 March , 2015 , 05 : 26 AM The nature of Pat Cummins ' injury is unknown. © Getty Pat Cummins is likely to miss the game against Afghanistan in Perth on Wednesday , according to reports. Cummins , who scored an unbeaten seven and picked up 2/38 in the game against New Zealand in Auckland on Saturday , will most likely be replaced by Josh Hazlewood . During the fourth ball in his first over , Cummins tripped on his right ankle while in his delivery stride but he was up and running immediately. It is believed that the 21-year-old complained of soreness when the team landed in Perth and he has picked up a " slight side strain " . A Cricket Australia spokesperson said scans showed nothing serious. Cummins will be monitored closely by the medical team in the coming days and a call on his availability for the game against Sri Lanka in Sydney will be taken soon . Cummins , who has been plagued with various injuries since the start of his international career in 2011 , was playing in his first World Cup match and this latest injury is another set-back for him. With James Faulkner still struggling to regain fitness , another injury could throw Australia 's campaign in jeopardy. The hosts are currently in fourth position with three points from three games and the game in Perth is a must-win for them . © Cricbuzz ( with inputs from agencies ) Tags
