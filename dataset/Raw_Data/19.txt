Anyone asked what Aus thinks of our t20 in June when pee-ing down in Sydney ? # t20debate by CDCCBrooksy via twitter 1/14/2015 6 : 48 : 45 PM Improvement for cricket is needed but good to see @ ECB_cricket will base on fact rather than unbased opinion # t20debate by CDCCBrooksy via twitter 1/14/2015 6 : 47 : 52 PM ( 2 of 2 ) and Premier League football does not work.

" - Colin Graves # T20debate # NWBlast by fwildecricket via twitter 1/14/2015 5 : 54 : 49 PM " Clarke lined up as first ECB president " - this position seems rather unnecessary and narcissistic , why cant @ ECB_cricket invest in bringing Prof Steve Peters into the England team , with the ridiculous amount of international cricket now facing these guys ( Giles Clarke has sold them down the river ) without any protection towards the effects of extreme mental fatigue , anxiety , over analysing your self and the build up of negative emotions...Prof Steve Peters has had incredible success with uk cycling / athletes and a few cricketers. would love to see him involved with our national team....I think he is a genius...get rid of some of the less important backroom staff or current psychologist....and bring in THE MAIN MAN !
