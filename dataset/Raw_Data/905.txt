Dhoni 's winning streak started in the 2011 World Cup , which India won at home . Last updated on Tuesday , 10 March , 2015 15 : 58 IST Total Shares MS Dhoni ovetakes Sourav Ganguly Â© Getty Images Mahendra Singh Dhoni has overtaken Sourav Ganguly with most consecutive World Cup match victories as India captain. India 's eight-wicket win against Ireland in Hamilton on Tuesday , was Dhoni 's ninth as captain. The winning streak started against the West Indies in the 2011 World Cup that India won at home. ( Match Report | Scorecard ) Australia 's Ricky Ponting holds the record for the most consecutive World Cup match wins as captain with 24. Dhoni and Clive Lloyd , who led West Indies to victory in the first two editions in 1975 and 1979 , have nine apiece. Ganguly had eight . Dhoni chose to underplay this personal feat and like a talismanic leader , put team before self. " It 's not about milestones. It about India winning and we want to take this forward. That 's the motivation for us , " Dhoni said in a post-match chat on TV. Tuesday 's emphatic victory was India 's fifth in-a-row and guarantees India the top spot in Pool B. ( India Have '99 % ' Chance to Retain the World Cup ) With every Indian win in this World Cup , Dhoni 's burgeoning cap keeps adding one feather after another. Dhoni has the most wins ( 12 ) by an Indian captain in World Cups. He has overtaken 1983 World Cup-winning skipper Kapil Dev ( 11 ) and Mohammed Azharuddin ( 10 ) . Ganguly has nine . Dhoni remains a team player despite owning almost every glorious record as skipper. He lauded his 2011 teammates and said the " right mix of youth and experience " helped India grow as a team . A captain 's role is not defined by statistics. Ponting may have some startling figures , but may not be Australia 's best captain. Dhoni 's reputation as a ODI captain is perhaps unquestionable. He is often compared to Ganguly but when the Prince of Kolkata , a tough critic of the game and extremely proud of his own achievements , is full of praise of Dhoni , there can be little doubt . On March 6 , Dhoni overtook Ganguly for most overseas ODI wins as a captain. Against West Indies in Perth , Dhoni struck a match-winning 45 not out in a tense low-scoring match. It was India 's fourth win on-the-trot in World Cup 2015 and that helped Dhoni record his 59th ODI victory away from home as captain , beating Ganguly 's record of 58 wins in 110 matches . " His record is very good in the shorter format of the games and in world tournaments. He has really done well for himself and India , " Ganguly praised Dhoni . There is still a lot of cricket in this World Cup and Dhoni seems to be peaking at the right time. He has been active as a captain from behind the wickets and every single move has paid off so far. Dhoni has truly been the man with the Midas touch . Touch wood !
