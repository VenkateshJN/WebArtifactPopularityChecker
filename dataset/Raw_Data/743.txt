Do join us back tomorrow for the England vs West Indies match at 0900 IST. Until then , it 's goodbye from all of us here ! ! Cummins was the pick of the bowlers for the hosts picking up three wickets for 30 in his 6 overs. Starc , Johnson and Hazlewood ably supported him picking up two wickets each. The wolf pack will surely be a threat in the World Cup . ! India never looked like getting to the total. Rohit and Kohli fell early. Rahane and Dhawan had a decent partnership but once Rahane fell , the Indian middle order collapsed. Only welcome for India in this match will be return of some sort of form for Dhawan. Rayudu played well to get to his fifty lower down the order but the match was far from over by then . 45.1 W mitchell starc to ravichandran ashwin OUT ! THAT ENDS IT !
