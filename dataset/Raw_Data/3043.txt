World Cup 2015 : New Zealand are no longer underdogs , says Arun Lal The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Mar 25 , 2015 , 05.03PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 NEW DELHI : Impressed with the brand of cricket played by New Zealand in the World Cup , former India batsman Arun Lal believes the Black Caps are no longer the underdogs in the mega event . The Brendan McCullum-led side crossed the semifinal hurdle for the first time in their seventh attempt as South Africa lost by four wickets via Duckworth-Lewis method in a close match in Auckland . Lal , like many , believes New Zealand played outstanding cricket . " New Zealand played outstanding cricket in this edition of the World Cup. Full marks for McCullum for leading the team so well. They have done justice to their fans ' passion and I believe they are no longer the underdogs in the tournament , " Lal said . South Africa , who did manage to win their first World Cup knockout after thrashing Sri Lanka in the quarter-finals , exited the last-four stage for the third time since 1992 and Lal said that the AB de Villiers side lived up to their chokers image . " It must be difficult for the South African players to come to terms with this defeat. The team has performed exceptionally well throughout the tournament and I believe their death bowling further accentuated their 'chokers ' tag . " In the final overs , South Africa players were all over the place , they dropped catches , missed run outs and demonstrated some sloppy full length bowling which ended their journey in this World Cup , " said the cricketer-turned-analyst .
