( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 PUNE : Harbhajan Singh feels that the seamer-friendly pitches in domestic cricket are turning out to be detrimental to slow bowling skills , India 's traditional strength . " A lot of Indian batsmen play spin well... but the wickets are not helping the spinners anymore , " the Turbanator , who will turn out for Punjab in the Group B match against Maharashtra starting here on Sunday , said on Friday. " They leave a lot of grass to make sure the pitch remains good and fast bowlers get some help. But once the grass goes , they turn out to be flat pitches with no help for the spinners at all. " After two rounds of league matches in the Ranji Trophy , seamers dominate the bowling chart with no spinner featuring in the top-10 wicket-takers list. " We have to understand our soil conditions and need to prepare challenging wickets. There must be something for the fast bowlers on Day One , then the batsmen , and the spinners must come into play on the fourth day We must make sure the skill is not killed with one-sided matches. " The 34-year-old bemoaned the declining interest among the public for first-class cricket. " It 's a sad story. Not a single guy comes to watch a Ranji match , " he said. " I have played county cricket and a lot of people come to support their home teams.The BCCI has all the tools. It has to plan to bring in people for the four-day games and definitely for the domestic one-dayers and T20 matches.
