World Cup 2015 : We need to hit the Kiwis at the top , says Lloyd The author has posted comments on this article Dwaipayan Datta , TNN | Mar 21 , 2015 , 12.28PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 WELLINGTON : Clive Lloyd has won a couple of World Cups as the captain of West Indies and it sounds like a huge compromise when he says he is proud to see the current team make the quarterfinals . But that 's the sad reality of West Indies cricket and the chairman of selectors knows all about it . " Not too many people expected us to come this far but I think we have played fairly good cricket and I am proud of what they have achieved , " Lloyd , who led one of the greatest sides in world cricket ever , said on the sidelines of the practice session at Basin Reserve . Lloyd used to set lofty standards for West Indies during his heydays , but the 70-year-old now states clearly that his team is not the favourite against New Zealand . He is hoping for Chris Gayle to be fit for Saturday 's clash so that they have the chance to derail the Kiwis. " We will know in the morning if Chris is fit to play , " Lloyd said . The legend is also hoping for the pace bowling pair of Jason Holder and Jerome Taylor to strike early. " Sometimes their middle order has n't played that well. If we have to move ahead and make the semifinals , we will need to hit them at the top , " Lloyd added . But he knows that his pace bowlers have their tasks cut out against Brendon McCullum. " Brendon is the AB de Villiers of New Zealand. He is really playing some great cricket and I would think these two guys have been the two best batsmen of the World Cup , " Lloyd added .
