( Getty Images ) Page 1 of 4 As India get ready for the Tri-Series in Australia , fans may recall that the Men In Blue have n't had a great time in this ODI tournament. India have played seven times in this championship , with their sole triumph coming in 2007-08. They have , however , played some memorable matches in this event. TOI takes a look at India 's journey so far.. . 1980-81 ( Aus , Ind , NZ ) India started with a bang , stunning Australia by 66 runs in the very first game and winning the next against New Zealand. From there , however , things went downhill. India logged just one more win in their next six outings and crashed out before the final. The lowest point came when they folded up for 63 against Australia in Sydney . Matches : 8 , Won : 2 , Lost : 6. Top performers Batsman : Dilip Vengsarkar , M : 10 , Runs : 221 , 50 : 2 , 100 : 0 , HS : 66 , Avg : 22.10 Bowler : Dilip Doshi , M : 10. Wickets : 15 , Best Bowling : 4-30 , Avg : 20.87 . 1985-86 ( Aus , Ind , NZ ) The World champs gave the tournament an exciting start by chasing down 259 against New Zealand. Later , India beat the Aussies too , but received flak after the way they abandoned the chase against the same opponents in Sydney. They eventually made it to the final for the first time , but squandered a golden opportunity by failing to chase 171 . Matches : 12 , Won : 5 , Lost : 7. Top performers Batsman : Sunil Gavaskar , M : 10 , Runs : 385 , 50 : 4 , 100 : 0 , HS : 92 * , Avg : 42.78 Bowler : Kapil Dev , M : 12. Wickets : 20 , Best Bowling : 4-30 , Avg : 19.55 . 1991-92 ( Aus , Ind , WI ) India were involved in a thrilling tie against West Indies in Perth , defending 126. A 107-run win over the Aussies followed but later the team lost to West Indies. They managed to reach the final but Australia were too good . M : 10 , Won : 3 , Lost : 6 , Tied : 1. Top performers Batsman : Sachin Tendulkar , M : 10 , Runs : 401 , 50 : 4 , 100 : 0 , HS : 77 , Avg : 44.56 Bowler : Manoj Prabhakar , M : 10.Wickets : 12 , Best Bowling : 3-31 , Avg : 26.25 . 1999-2000 ( Aus , Ind , Pak ) Easily India 's worst-ever outing in a Tri-Series Down Under. The listless show left skipper Tendulkar so frustrated that he decided to quit captaincy. Apart from a win against archrivals Pakistan , India had nothing to show. In Sydney , Aussie pace great Glenn McGrath returned amazing figures of four for eight in 10 overs as India caved in for 100. It got even worse in Adelaide , where India suffered a 152-run defeat . Matches : 8 , Won : 1 , Lost : 7. Top performers Batsman : Sourav Ganguly , M : 7 , Runs : 356 , 50 : 2 , 100 : 1 , HS : 141 , Avg : 50.85 Bowler : Javagal Srinath , M : 8. Wickets : 14 , Best Bowling : 430 , Avg : 27.50 . 2003-04 ( Aus , Ind , Zim ) India were competitive in this Triangular before fizzling out in the final. The high point came in Brisbane , where they beat the hosts by 18 runs. Laxman ( 104 ) , Tendulkar ( 86 ) & L Balaji ( 4-49 ) being the heroes of the win. In the finals , however , Australia came into its own , thrashing India by seven wickets and 208 runs to clinch the title. With three hundreds , Laxman redeemed his poor show in the previous edition . Matches : 10 , Won : 5 , Lost : 5. Top performers Batsman : VVS Laxman , M : 10 , Runs : 443 , 50 : 0 , 100 : 3 , HS : 131 , Avg : 63.28 Bowler : Irfan Pathan , M : 10. Wickets : 16 , Best Bowling : 4-24 , Avg : 31.06 . 2007-08 ( Aus , Ind , SL ) Powered by Tendulkar 's 117 not out & 91 in the finals against Australia , India went on to register their maiden triumph in an emotionally-charged atmosphere in light of the 'Monkeygate ' incident that happened in the Test series preceding the event. Ishant Sharma clocked 150-plus , Gautam Gambhir batted like a dream as India played inspired cricket under MS Dhoni . Hurt by criticism , Tendulkar bounced back in form just in time to fashion a memorable win . Matches : 10 , Won : 5 , Lost : 3 , NR : 2. Top performers Batsman : Gautam Gambhir , M : 10 , Runs : 440 , 50 : 1 , 100 : 2 , HS : 113 , Avg : 55.00 Bowler : Ishant Sharma , M : 9. Wickets : 14 , Best Bowling : 4-38 , Avg : 20.42 . Tendulkar bounced back in form just in time to fashion a memorable win. ( Getty Images ) 2012-13 ( Aus , Ind , SL ) With Dhoni implementing a debatable 'rotational ' policy while playing the senior players , India 's campaign was mired in controversy. Virat Kohli tried to salvage a sinking ship with a blazing , 86-ball 133 * which helped the team chase 321 in just the 37th over against Sri Lanka in Hobart , but it did n't prove enough. India failed to make the final . Matches : 8 , Won : 3 , Lost : 4 , Tied : 1. Top performers Batsman : Virat Kohli , M : 8 , Runs : 373 , 50 : 2 , 100 : 1 , HS : 133 * , Avg : 53.28 Bowler : Vinay Kumar , M : 6. Wickets : 9 , Best Bowling : 3-21 , Avg : 32.11 .
