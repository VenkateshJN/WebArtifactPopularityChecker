Irfan and Maqsood star in narrow Pakistan victory The author has posted comments on this article Reuters | Feb 9 , 2015 , 10.01PM IST Irfan 's five-wicket haul was a rare positive in Pakistan 's otherwise wayward bowling effort. ( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 SYDNEY : Sohaib Maqsood spared Pakistan 's blushes by hitting an unbeaten 93 to secure the team 's three-wicket victory over Bangladesh in their first World Cup warm-up match on Monday . Maqsood 's 90-ball knock took Pakistan home with 11 balls to spare but their top order looked far from convincing as they chased 247 runs for victory . Having beaten the former champions in the 1999 World Cup , Bangladesh rekindled hopes of another upset by reducing Pakistan to 199 for six in the 43rd over but were thwarted by Maqsood who hit nine fours and two sixes . Bangladesh posted a competitive 246 after opting to bat first but were all out with one delivery to go in their innings . They lost two quick wickets but Tamim Iqbal ( 81 ) and Mahmudullah ( 83 ) added 168 runs to consolidate the innings . Iqbal 's 109-ball knock will please captain Mashrafe Mortaza the most as the left-handed opener was returning to action after undergoing knee surgery in December . Down the order , all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan scored a brisk 31 before Mohammad Irfan ( 5-52 ) ripped through the middle and lower order . Towering Irfan 's five-wicket haul was a rare positive in Pakistan 's otherwise wayward bowling effort , underlined by the 17 wides they conceded . Pakistan 's top order did little to convince their fans and the 1992 champions were 52 for three in the 16th over before Maqsood and Harris Sohail ( 39 ) steadied the innings with a 51-run stand . Umar Akmal fell after contributing 39 but Maqsood guided them home . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
