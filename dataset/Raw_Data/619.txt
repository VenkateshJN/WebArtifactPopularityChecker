Â© AP London : Yorkshire have signed India 's Cheteshwar Pujara until the end of May after cancelling the contract of Younus Khan , the English county champions announced on Wednesday . Veteran batsman Younus was due to be Yorkshire 's overseas player for 2015 , but his desire to join Pakistan 's tour of Bangladesh has effectively ruled him out of the County Championship , opening the door for Pujara . " I was looking to return to the UK after my previous experience of county cricket , which I greatly enjoyed , " said 27-year-old Pujara , who scored 219 runs for Derbyshire last season . " When Yorkshire made the offer , I did n't think twice. To wear the same white rose Sachin Tendulkar did is going to be a great feeling for me. I hope I can contribute to further success. " Pujara , who has scored nearly 9,000 first-class runs , will be available for Yorkshire until Australian Aaron Finch returns from playing in the Indian Premier League . " We have moved quickly to bring in Pujara and he is a superb player , " Yorkshire director of cricket Martyn Moxon told the club 's website . " He is an outstanding young Test cricketer , who is hungry to perform in the English game.
