Kevin Pietersen finally won his first toss of this IPL season. ( PTI Photo ) RELATED NEW DELHI : Delhi Daredevils skipper Kevin Pietersen won the toss and elected to bat against Kolkata Knight Riders in their IPL match at the Ferozeshah Kotla in New Delhi on Wednesday . Both the teams have made one change each to their sides. Delhi have left out pacer Jaydev Unadkat to include Siddarth Kaul while KKR have brought back Jacques Kallis in place of Andre Russell . Wallowing at the bottom half of the points table , the Daredevils showed some signs of improvement against the strong Chennai Super Kings side. The batting fired collectively to post a competitive score of 178 . Now they are up against a side which has been left badly bruised after a heart-breaking loss to Rajasthan Royals. KKR had no business losing a match placed at 121 for no loss chasing 171 but lost six wickets for two runs thereafter . Delhi skipper Kevin Pietersen , though , is not prepared to take this game lightly , knowing fully well that they pretty much need to win every single game to remain in the hunt for playoffs . Knight Riders ' batting has been as brittle as their temperament and just when skipper Gautam Gambhir is finding his touch , the rest of the line-up is letting him down . Teams : Delhi Daredevils : Kevin Pietersen ( Capt. ) , Quinton de Kock , Murali Vijay , Dinesh Karthik , Laxmi Ratan Shukla , JP Duminy , Kedar Jadhav , Wayne Parnell , Shahbaz Nadeem , Mohammed Shami and Siddarth Kaul . Kolkata Knight Riders : Gautam Gambhir ( Capt. ) , Robin Uthappa , Manish Pandey , Jacques Kallis , Shakib Al Hasan , Yusuf Pathan , Ryan ten Doeschate , Suryakumar Yadav , R Vinay Kumar , Sunil Narine and Umesh Yadav . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Kolkata Knight Riders,Kevin Pietersen,IPL,Gautam Gambhir,Delhi Daredevils Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
