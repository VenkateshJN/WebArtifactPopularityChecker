6.25 ( 1nb , 1w ) 11.3 to Klinger , hits in the air with one hand off the handle to deep midwicket and Abbott takes it. 70/1 19.4 to Coulter-Nile , knocked him over ! Do we have a twist on the cards here ? Binga in his final over in cricket bowls one full and straight. Coulter-Nile jumps outside off to scoop and misses. Lee does n't , topples the stumps and out comes the vintage chainsaw celebration ! 147/5 19.5 to Whiteman , got 'im ! Runs in from around the wicket for a length ball on middle and off stump , Whiteman makes some room for himself to drive through the covers and fails to connect. What an over to bowl in your final match ! 147/6
