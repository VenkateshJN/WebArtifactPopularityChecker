( Smith should remain captain even if Clarke returns : Ian Chappell ) Clarke has previously said he is unlikely to be fit for Australia 's opening match of the tournament against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on February 14 . But Clarke said he was experiencing a quicker-than-expected recovery and could yet be ready to play . Speaking on Channel Nine 's television coverage of the fourth Test against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground , Clarke said he was doing three sessions of practice daily as he ramped up his preparation for the World Cup . " It 's going well , it 's feeling really good , " Clarke said. " I 'm slowly getting back into my running , but I 'm not running too quickly . " I 'm three weeks post-surgery yesterday and I 'm happy , the surgeon is extremely happy and the Australian medical staff are happy . " I just have to make sure I do n't do too much and progress as slowly as I need to. But as it is , I 'm ahead of schedule and everyone is extremely pleased. " It has been a frustrating time for Clarke after he overcame a left hamstring injury to play the opening Adelaide Test against India , but suffered a flare-up of his degenerative back condition on day one . Clarke retired hurt , returning to the crease the next day and completed a courageous and well-received hundred . Clarke then injured his right hamstring while fielding on the final day , with scans ruling him out of the rest of the four-Test series .
