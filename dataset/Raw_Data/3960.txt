Memorable moments - 1983 : India vs West Indies The author has posted comments on this article TNN | Feb 5 , 2015 , 11.57AM IST Page 1 of 4 MOHINDER 'S GOLDEN ARM Mohinder Amarnath 's was the last act in India 's first World Cup triumph against West Indies - trapping Michael Holding lbw and then running away from the onrushing fans to the safety of the Lord 's balcony . His Man of the Final award was well-deserved having scored 26 and taking 3-12. However , it was one of his most undeserving deliveries that turned the match for India . Despite losing Viv Richards , Larry Gomes , Clive Lloyd and Faoud Bachchus within the space of 19 runs , the defending champions fought back with a 43-run partnership between Jeff Dujon and Malcolm Marshall . Then , Kapil Dev gave the ball to Mohinder . Dujon first tried to negotiate a wide delivery outside the off stump and then changed his mind to leave the ball. In the bargain , he dragged the ball on to the stumps for a bizarre dismissal . 7 : Hat-tricks recorded in the World Cup . Lasith Malinga is the only one to have accomplished the feat twice once each vs South Africa and Kenya. Five bowlers have achieved the distinction once Chaminda Vaas , Brett Lee , Kemar Roach , Saqlain Mushtaq and Chetan Sharma . 6 : All-rounders to have managed 500 runs or more and 20 wickets or more in the World Cup -Sanath Jayasuriya : 1165 runs + 27 wickets in 38 matches ; Jacques Kallis : 1148 + 21 in 36 ; Steve Waugh : 978 + 27 in 33 ; Imran Khan : 666 + 34 in 28 ; Kapil Dev : 669 + 28 in 26 ; Yuvraj Singh : 738 + 20 in 23 .
