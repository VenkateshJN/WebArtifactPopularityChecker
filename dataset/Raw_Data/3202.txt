2011 : Quarterfinals Key player : AB de Villiers - De Villiers is likely to go into the World Cup as the world 's number one ranked one-day international batsman. South Africa 's captain underlined his outrageous ability when he broke the world record for the fastest ODI fifty and century , reaching the latter mark off 31 balls on the way to scoring 149 off 44 deliveries against the West Indies in January . At his best De Villiers has the ability to destroy the best bowling attacks with strokes that most other batsmen would not even attempt. But he is also able to adapt his game to circumstances and if necessary to bat with a tight defence in a crisis situation , although seldom eschewing a scoring opportunity . If South Africa are to break their hoodoo of never having won a World Cup knockout game they will be looking to De Villiers to bat deep into an innings .
