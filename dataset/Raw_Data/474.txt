( Steve Smith emulates Don Bradman , Kallis ) Watson appeared certain to reach his ton , when he got out. Moody then spoke about how an experienced player like him could play such a shot , but also credited Watson for a " good " innings . " I ca n't understand , for one minute , why Watson has played that shot , he has worked so hard to get to the point he got to , it was n't a fluent innings , but you 'd have to say it 's a good innings given the fact he is reconstructing himself as a Test cricketer , " Moody was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au Wednesday . The 33-year-old all-rounder ahead of the Sydney Test earlier said that he was working hard on his game to score as many as possible , but was under immense pressure to perform since it has been a year he last scored a ton in Tests . " I 've been working very hard on my game , to be able to put all the pieces together after breaking it down in the off-season , " Watson had said Saturday . " If I 'm not performing of course I 'm under pressure. The thing I think about the most is to just being able to contribute to the team , not whether I 'm playing or not " .
