IPL 2013 : Spot fixing controversy ( Full Coverage ) SC bars N Srinivasan from contesting BCCI polls New Delhi , 2015/Jan/22 04 : 38 : 00 Text Size © Cricbuzz Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) and Rajasthan Royals ( RR ) could face the axe after India 's Supreme Court held their respective team principals Gurunath Meiyappan and Raj Kundra guilty of betting in the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) on Thursday . There was some relief for N Srinivasan , however , as the Court cleared him of any wrongdoings , but held the conflict-of-interest case against him and asked the BCCI to hold elections within the next six months. At best , the SC ruled , there was only a case of suspicion against Srinivasan of cover-up . The Court clearly stated that no individual with commercial interests will be allowed to contest the elections , meaning that Srinivasan can not contest for the post of BCCI chief until he clears himself of conflict of interest. The BCCI elections will go on as scheduled . As for Meiyappan and Kundra , the SC has set up a three-member committee comprising retired judges , RM Lodha , Ashok Bhan and RV Ravindran , to decide the punishment. In a 130-page verdict , Justice TS Thakur and Justice FM Khalifullah stressed that all BCCI functions were public function , thus subject to judicial review. The court also panned the BCCI for bringing amendments to the cause 6.2.4 that allowed BCCI officials to have stakes in the IPL teams. The SC also said IPL COO Sundar Raman needed further probe . The SC 's order came after 17 months of hearings and investigations in relation to the role of BCCI and IPL administrators in the IPL controversy . © Cricbuzz ( with inputs from agencies ) More stories from IPL 2013 : Spot fixing controversy
