Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 Pakistan , yet to register a win in the tournament , put together yet another shambolic batting performance after electing to bat on winning the toss . The openers -- Nasir Jamshed ( 1 ) and Ahmed Shehzad ( 0 ) -- were back in the pavillion within the first five overs with just four runs on the board . Misbah , who has been criticised for scoring at a slow rate , steadied the ship with a couple of decent partnerships. He first shared a 54-run stand with Harris Sohail ( 27 off 44 balls ) before stitching together 69 runs in the company of Umar Akmal ( 33 off 42 balls ) . But the pace of scoring was such that Pakistan could not even capitalise on the fielding blunders that the Zimbabweans committed . The proceedings became a tad exciting courtesy Riaz , who smashed half a dozen fours and a six during the course of his entertaining knock . For Zimbabwe , paceman Tandai Chatara stood out with a three-wicket haul , which cost only 35 runs , off his 10 overs -- two of them maiden . Left-arm spinner Sean Williams picked up two wickets , conceding 48 runs in his 10 overs , one of which was a maiden. In all , five of the 50 overs bowled were maiden .
