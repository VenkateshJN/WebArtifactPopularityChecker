But there 's a different charm to cricket when India and Australia are up against each other. For a long time , India was the 'Final Frontier ' for the men from Down Under. On the other hand , the Indians were invariably struggling on the 'fast paced bouncy ' tracks in Australia . Tigers at home , lambs abroad was the popular phrase used to describe the Indians on their previous overseas tours. Australia , who had not long ago been the reigning champions in Test Cricket now , are placed at Number Two with South Africa having taken the top spot . India with 96 points to their name and languishing at the sixth place will be wishing to make the best of this long tour of Australia , a series that consists of four Tests , a triangular series and ends with the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup. The likes of Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara will have their techniques tested to the limit , once again by the Australian pace battery. They were left badly bruised in England and ca n't afford yet another disaster in Australia . Over the years , the two teams have been involved in some close contests ; there have been heart-stopping moments , tense finishes and some drab draws.
