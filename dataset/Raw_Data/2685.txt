( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 DUBAI : Former Indian captain Anil Kumble is all set to become the 77th member of the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame after his name is inducted in the prestigious list during India 's World Cup match against South Africa on Sunday . Kumble , who is now the chairman of the ICC Cricket Committee , is the fourth India cricketer to be inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame after fellow former captains Bishen Bedi , Kapil Dev and Sunil Gavaskar were inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in 2009 . Joining Kumble as the 78th inductee would be the late Betty Wilson , one of the greatest women 's cricketers of all-time . Kumble , with 619 Test wickets , is the third highest wicket-taker in Test cricket after Muttiah Muralidaran ( 800 ) and Shane Warne ( 708 ) , while his 337 wickets in ODIs ranks him in ninth position on the all-time list of most successful bowlers in that format. Kumble captained India in 14 Tests between 2007 and 2008 , winning three and losing five . In the 138-year history of Test cricket during which 2,156 Tests have been played to date , Kumble is one of only two bowlers after England 's Jim Laker to have taken all 10 wickets in an innings. He achieved this feat against traditional rival Pakistan in New Delhi in February 1999 . Kumble made his Test debut in 1990 in Manchester and his final appearance was in New Delhi in October-November 2008. During his career , Kumble played 132 Tests and 271 one-day internationals. Apart from his 619 Test and 337 ODI wickets , Kumble also scored 2,506 runs in Tests and 938 runs in ODIs . Wilson , a former Australia batter , played 11 Tests between 1947 and 1958 in which she scored 862 runs at average of 57.4 and took 68 wickets at 11.8 per wicket . On her debut against New Zealand at the age of 26 in 1948 , Wilson scored 90 and took four for 37 and six for 28. In her second Test , she scored 111 against England , becoming the first Australia woman to score a Test century against England , and took nine more wickets. Against England in 1957-58 , she became the first cricketer , male or female , to score a century and take 10 wickets in a Test . Wilson passed away on January 22 , 2010 , aged 88. Kumble and Wilson will be formally inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame during the innings break in the India versus South Africa match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday . ICC director and chairman of Cricket Australia , Mr Wally Edwards , will present Kumble with his commemorative cap , while Wilson 's commemorative cap will be received by her nephew , Ken Wilson , from ICC chief executive David Richardson . Reacting to the news about his induction into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame , a modest Kumble said : " It 's an honour to be inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Indeed , it will be a great moment of pride to receive it during the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. I deem it as a great privilege to join the list of great cricketing luminaries. " ICC chief executive David Richardson congratulated Kumble on his induction . " Anil was an outstanding international cricketer , a very well-respected opponent , a great statesman for his country and a role model for millions of aspiring cricketers. He played hard but within the spirit of the game. His performance and record speak volumes for his tenacity , commitment , endurance and service to the game.
