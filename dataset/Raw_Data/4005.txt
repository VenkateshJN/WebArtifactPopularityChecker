Mumbai coach Pravin Amre decided to implement this theory while preparing his struggling team for its must-win Ranji Trophy game against Baroda which begins from Thursday at the Moti Baug ground in Baroda . " I told the boys about our memorable win here against the hosts in the 2006-07 Ranji semifinal , when we came back to win the game despite being zero for five in the second innings. Hopefully , this example would have fired them up , " Amre told TOI on Wednesday . Following the resignation of Suryakumar Yadav , Mumbai are playing under a new captain , Aditya Tare , for the first time. Amre was confident that the wicketkeeper would adjust to the big responsibility quickly . " He is a senior play now. All the players are professionals , and know that the team comes first. The team is determined to score a win in this game , " the coach said . With the Pathan brothers -Irfan and Yusuf leading their challenge , Baroda will be a tough nut to crack. They also have an in-form left-arm spinner , Swapnil Singh ( 25 wickets @ 23.76 ) in their arsenal. Young batsman Deepak Hooda ( 477 runs in six games @ 68.14 ) too has impressed for them this season . With the pitch likely to offer turn from Day Two , Mumbai are likely to play recalled left-arm spinner Harmeet Singh and offie Akshay Girap. Both the senior left-arm spinners - Iqbal Abdulla and Vishal Dabholkar - were dropped after an unimpressive show on a turning track in Chennai against Tamil Nadu .
