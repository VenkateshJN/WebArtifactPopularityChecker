A draw on the cards ? 12 : 21 PM IST : Lyon has single-handedly turned the match around today. India were cruising away at one stage but his wicket of Murali Vijay stopped India on their tracks.

This is the big one , the one Australia needed. Kohli falls to Lyon for 141 and stays rooted to his crease - a figure of extreme disappointment.

The 141 was Kohli 's career-best in Test cricket . 12 : 01 PM IST : WICKET ! That 's the end of Saha as he charges down the pitch to Lyon. Bowled ! Lyon picks up his second fifer - 10 for the match.

Virat Kohli joins Vijay in the middle . — cricket.com.au ( @ CricketAus ) December 13 , 2014 6 : 18 IST : This has been a wonderful partnership between Pujara and Vijay after Dhawan 's exit. Pujara has been the more aggressive of the two and has used his feet very well. It is all about buying time . 6 : 05 AM IST : India are 41/1 off 14 overs and both Vijay and Pujara are looking very assured in the middle. These two men will be key to India saving the Test because a win , chasing 364 on a wearing surface looks far-fetched . 5 : 52 AM IST : Nathan Lyon has already bowled two overs out of 11 this morning. Australia are clearly thinking a couple of more wickets before lunch which is still some time away. The Aussie off-spinner troubled the Indian batsmen on Day 3 and there is every reason why he can do it yet. Can Pujara and Vijay establish a strong stand here ? Warner , who had a tiff with Dhawan on Day 4 is elated after Johnson knocked him out . © AP 5 : 38 AM IST : Dhawan has managed an average of 19.5 in his last eight Test innings ( six in England and two in Australia ) .
