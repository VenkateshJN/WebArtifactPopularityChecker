Plus , Sangakkara 's prolific 2014 , players with stumpings and caught-bowled dismissals , and losing despite high first-innings totals shares Mark Waugh is the top run-getter among overseas batsmen in ODIs in New Zealand © Getty Images Kumar Sangakkara scored nearly 3000 international runs in 2014 , was this a record ? asked Hemachandra de Silva from Sri Lanka In all , Kumar Sangakkara scored 2868 runs in international cricket in 2014 - 1493 in Tests , 1256 in ODIs , and 119 in T20 internationals ( this excludes his 16 in the first innings of the Test against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi , which started on December 31 , 2013 ) . This is indeed a new overall record : Ricky Ponting scored 2833 international runs in 2005. Sangakkara 's Sri Lankan ream-mate Angelo Mathews is in third place , after a crowded year : he made 2687 runs in 2014. Ponting also scored 2657 international runs in 2003 , Rahul Dravid 2626 in 1999 , and Sangakkara 2609 in 2006. For the full list , click here . Brendon McCullum hit 33 Test sixes in 2014. Was this another record ? asked Tushar Mukherjee from the United States That 's a good spot , as Brendon McCullum 's 33 sixes in 2014 improved the previous calendar-year record by 50 % ! Adam Gilchrist hit 22 sixes in 2005 , and Virender Sehwag equalled that in 2008. Andrew Flintoff smote 21 sixes in 2004 , and Matthew Hayden 20 in both 2001 and 2003. McCullum 's 164 fours in 2014 was another New Zealand record , but well short of the overall one : Mohammad Yousuf hit 234 fours in 2006 , breaking Viv Richards ' old mark of 230 in 1976 . This year Brendon McCullum joined the group who have both a caught-and-bowled and a stumping in their Test career. How many players have managed that ? asked Jeremy Hall from New Zealand Brendon McCullum 's first Test wicket - Sarfraz Ahmed caught and bowled in Dubai in November - made him the 16th man to have both a wicket and a stumping to their credit in Tests. Among the others on the list are AB de Villiers , Tatenda Taibu and Mark Boucher of recent vintage. Another New Zealander , John Reid , is also there : his 85 Test wickets ( a record for anyone who also made a stumping ) included two caught-and-bowleds , Denis Atkinson of West Indies and South Africa 's Peter Pollock. But Reid was n't really a wicketkeeper - he stumped England 's Peter Richardson at Old Trafford in 1958 while briefly deputising for the injured Eric Petrie. Clyde Walcott , who kept wicket regularly in his early Tests , later managed two caught-and-bowleds ( Vijay Hazare and Tom Graveney ) ; he 's the only man to manage double figures for stumpings and wickets , with 11 of each. Another occasional West Indian wicketkeeper , Robert Christiani , took 3 for 52 against India at Delhi in 1948-49 , and one of those ( Dattu Phadkar ) was caught and bowled . At what number did the Don bat in Tests ? asked Arinjaya Khare from India Don Bradman scored most of his Test runs from No. 3 : in all he made 5078 of his eventual 6996 runs from there , at an average of 103.63. He did occasionally go in further down : in ten innings at No. 4 he scored 485 runs at 53.88 ; from three knocks at No. 5 he made 427 runs at 142.33 ( including a triple-century at Headingley in 1934 ) ; in six appearances at No. 6 there were 681 runs at 97.28 ; and in three outings at No. 7 he made 325 runs at 162.50 , most notably a series-turning 270 against England in Melbourne in 1936-37 , when he held himself back in the order while a wet pitch dried a bit . What is the highest first-innings total in a Test that resulted in defeat ? asked Pete Abrahams from South Africa There have been 13 occasions in Tests when a first-innings total of more than 500 has n't been enough to prevent defeat. The highest of all is 586 , by Australia against England in Sydney in 1894-95 , in the first of only three Tests which have ever been won by a side that followed on. Pakistan declared their first innings at 574 for 8 against Australia in Melbourne in 1972-73 , but still ended up losing. There 's only one instance of a team scoring more than 500 in their second innings but losing : India amassed 510 against England at Headingley in 1967 , but they were up against a first-innings deficit of nearly 400 . With reference to the recent question about the imminent World Cup , it 's also being played in New Zealand : who are the best performers in ODIs there ? asked Tim Pate from New Zealand Yes , I was dimly aware that I 'd left New Zealand out last time. The leading visiting batsman in one-day internationals played there is Mark Waugh , with 891 runs ; Sachin Tendulkar had 821 , and Ricky Ponting 752. Leading the way for the bowlers is Javagal Srinath , with 43 wickets , ahead of Wasim Akram ( 37 ) . The leading New Zealand batsmen in home ODIs are Nathan Astle ( 3348 runs ) and Stephen Fleming ( 2975 ) , with Brendon McCullum third on 2406 at the moment. Their leading bowler is Daniel Vettori , with 113 one-day wickets ; Chris Cairns and Chris Harris both took 94. Taking Australia and New Zealand together , the leading overseas batsman is still Desmond Haynes , with 3276 runs , while the top bowler is Wasim Akram ( 124 wickets ) .
