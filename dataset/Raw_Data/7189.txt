The rate at which Amla has accumulated ODI hundreds and MoM awards is among the fastest in history. And his runs-per-innings figure is easily the best of the lot shares 70 Hashim Amla has a runs-per-innings value of 50.42 in ODIs , which is well clear of all other batsmen who have scored at least 2000 runs Â© Getty Images The New Zealand-South Africa ODI series was a blink-and-you 'll-miss-it affair - three ODIs , of which one was ruined by the weather - but even in this short series Hashim Amla stamped his class. In the second game , in Mount Maunganui , his 119 set South Africa up for a comfortable 72-run win. It was his 16th ODI hundred in only his 94th innings , and his fifth in 16 innings over the last 11 months : since December 2013 , Amla has scored 914 runs at an average of 60.93 and a strike rate of 80.88. Even by his usually prolific standards , these are outstanding numbers , and a fine return to form after a patchy previous 11 months : between January and November 2013 , he scored only one hundred in 19 ODI innings , and averaged 34.73 . For a player who was seen as a long-format specialist when he first came into international cricket , Amla has done remarkably well in one-day cricket. Batting at the top of the order has suited him perfectly , allowing him to build innings and play for longer periods. He has also justified that move to push him up the order , converting his starts and getting centuries more regularly than any other player who has at least 15 hundreds in this format : in fact , Amla is the only one who averages less than six innings per ODI century. His 16 hundreds have come in 95 innings , an average of one every 5.94 , which is even more prolific than Virat Kohli , who averages one every 6.65 innings . Batting at the top of the order gives Amla the luxury of knowing he has plenty of overs in hand , but it also considerably reduces the chances of him being not-out. In 95 innings , he has remained unbeaten only seven times , and yet he averages more than 54 , which means his runs-per-innings value ( runs scored divided by all innings , including not-outs ) is incredibly high. At 50.42 , Amla 's RPI is 14 % better than the next highest , among batsmen who have scored at least 2000 ODI runs. Kohli is second again in this list , with an RPI of 44.20 . In terms of batting averages , the two who follow Amla 's 54.43 are very close to that number : Michael Bevan scored 6912 runs at 53.58 , while MS Dhoni has 8192 runs at an average of 52.85. However , both have batted mostly in the middle order or lower middle order , which means there are plenty of not-outs in their overall stats. Bevan had 67 not-outs in 196 innings , which helped boost his average significantly ; his RPI is 35.27. Similarly , Dhoni has 64 not-outs in 219 innings ; his RPI is only slightly better , at 37.41. AB de Villiers averages 51.02 , but because of 29 not-outs , his RPI is nine runs lower than his average. While there are 13 batsmen with RPIs between 37 and 44.20 , Amla stands alone at 50.42 , well clear of the rest . Highest runs/innings in ODIs ( Qual : 2000 runs ) Batsman
