Â© Getty Images Canberra : Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis hit centuries , while Dale Steyn shone in his 100th one-day international , as South Africa showcased their prowess with a 201-run rout of Ireland in the World Cup on Tuesday . Amla scored 159 off 128 balls to become the fastest man to reach 20 ODI centuries and du Plessis made 109 as the Proteas piled up a massive 411 for four after taking first strike at Canberra 's Manuka Oval . Steyn put aside worries of mountain fires near his home in Cape Town as he bowled a hostile opening spell to wreck Ireland with two wickets in his first three overs . The fast bowler , who had grabbed just three wickets in South Africa 's first three pool matches , finished with two for 39 and Kyle Abbott grabbed four for 21 as Ireland were bundled out for 210 in 45 overs . The Irish were reduced to 21 for three by the fifth over and slipped to 48 for five by the 11th before Andy Balbirnie ( 58 ) and Kevin O'Brien ( 48 ) led a late revival by adding 81 for the sixth wicket . South Africa 's third win in four matches brought them level on six points with defending champions India , who have played one less match , in Pool B . Ireland have four points from three games . Amla and du Plessis put on 247 off 217 balls for the second wicket to lift South Africa to the second highest total in World Cup history , just two runs behind India 's record 413 for five against Bermuda in 2007 . It was the second successive 400-plus total for the Proteas in the current tournament , following their 408 for five against the West Indies in Sydney last week in which skipper AB de Villiers hammered 162 off 66 balls . With victory almost assured , de Villiers used eight bowlers -- including himself -- ahead of tougher games . Amla smashed 16 boundaries and four sixes , while du Plessis contributed 10 fours and a six in a scintillating display of attacking batting on a dry , run-laden pitch . Both batsmen were dismissed in the space of three overs , but Rilee Rossouw hit an unbeaten 61 off 30 balls and David Miller chipped in with 46 not out as South Africa hammered 131 runs in the last 10 overs . Prior to Amla and du Plessis 's stand , Ireland were initially in the game when seamer John Mooney , whose first two overs were maidens , had Quinton de Kock caught behind for one . South Africa would have been in further trouble when Kevin O'Brien , who became Ireland 's most-capped player on Tuesday with 87 ODI appearances , came on in the sixth over and nearly claimed a wicket with his first ball . Amla , then on 10 , flicked uppishly to short mid-wicket where Ed Joyce , normally a safe catcher , dropped the ball after getting both hands to it . Ireland paid dearly for the lapse as seamer Max Sorensen conceded 24 runs in one over , with Amla smashing him for two sixes and a four and du Plessis lofting him for six . In the second powerplay , Amla took 26 runs off one Mooney over with a sequence of two , four , four , six , four , six. An additional run came off a no-ball . Amla 's career-best century , in his 108th innings , was a new record , with India 's Virat Kohli being the next fastest to reach 20 ODI hundreds in 133 innings . South Africa next play Pakistan in Auckland on March 7 , while Ireland take on Zimbabwe in Hobart the same day .
