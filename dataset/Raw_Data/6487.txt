1 ( 4w ) 3.5 to Guptill , 146.8 kph , taken at mid off , Guptill 's gone ! It was pitched up again , Guptill merely chipped it down the ground with a drive , maybe looking to clear mid off , but Cummins went to his right to complete a good catch 40/1 8.1 to Taylor , 145.0 kph , knocks him over , there goes the off stump ! Taylor tried a cross-batted shot for the length delivery just around off , the ball swung in and went right through the gate to rattle the off stump. The players head off for what was supposed to be innings break at this time 79/3 8.2 to Elliott , 149.3 kph , middle stump 's gone , first ball ! Elliott left a big gap between bat and pad for the straight delivery that pitched around off and came in to rattle middle stump , he did n't have much footwork either and pushed only tentatively at the ball. Happens on the first ball 79/4 20.6 to Ronchi , 141.3 kph , peach of a delivery from Starc and that deserves a wicket ! Nasty bouncer around middle stump , it was quick , and by the time Ronchi could sway out of the line by bending back like Keanu Reaves , the ball took some glove on the way 139/6 22.3 to Milne , 142.7 kph , Starc pumps the air , he 's hit the stumps ! Full delivery on middle , Milne exposed his stumps a bit , went for the drive and missed it completely 146/8 22.4 to Southee , 144.6 kph , GONE , Starc 's on fire ! He knows how to bowl those yorkers , does n't he ! Targets the off stump , Southee tries to put it away on the leg side but it 's too quick at 150kmh and rattles the stumps 146/9
