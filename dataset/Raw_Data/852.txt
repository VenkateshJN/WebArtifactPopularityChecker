Refresh ! KUMAR SANGAKKARA is adjudged the Man of the Match for his brilliant batting performance. Sri Lanka now have 3 wins in 4 games and look good to make it to the quarterfinals. That 's it from the coverage of this game. Meanwhile you can switch to the Pakistan-Zimbabwe match where Pakistan are on the back foot with same early loss of wickets. We 'll be back on the 3rd , for the match between South Africa and Ireland. Until then , it 's goodbye ! ! England bowlers , especially the pacers looked very ordinary. James Anderson and Stuart Broad never looked lethal with the new ball and Chris Woakes and Steven Finn too looked wayward with their lines. Moeen Ali got a consolidation wicket of Dilshan and that remained the only wicket they picked up in this match. They need to come up stronger in their next outing if they are to qualify for the quarter-finals . ! Sri Lanka have done it ! They chase down this target with ease. Dilshan and Thirimanne started off well putting a century stand for the opening wicket. But once Dilshan departed , Sangakkara came in and continued the good work. They both stayed till the end sharing a match-winning unbeaten 212-run stand. Thirimanne got to his hundred and remained not out on 139 off 143 balls , whereas Sangakkara remained not out on 117 off just 86 balls . 47.2 6 chris woakes to lahiru thirimanne SIX ! FINISHES OFF IN STYLE ! Full on middle , Thirimanne heaves it over long on into the stands for a maximum and that does it for the Lankans. SRI LANKA WIN BY 9 WICKETS . 47.1 chris woakes to kumar sangakkara Full on off , Sangakkara drives it to mid off for a single . 47.1
