KARACHI 1987 Before the 2015 World Cup , Gary Kirsten 's 188 was the highest individual score in the tournament. In that period , four World Cup tournaments were played but no one threatened his score. In that period , Sachin Tendulkar had achieved history when he became the first batsman to score a double ton in ODIs against South Africa in Gwalior in March 2010 . However , in this tournament , Kirsten 's record has been sidetracked by two spectacular knocks. Chris Gayle was the first to shatter the record when he became the first batsman to score a double hundred in the World Cup when he smashed 215 against Zimbabwe in Canberra. Many felt that this record would be here to stay. But , no one told this to Martin Guptill. He smashed an unbeaten 237 and shattered Gayle 's record in just under a month . Guptill also became the highest individual scorer for New Zealand in ODIs in World Cups , breaking the 40-year record set by Glenn Turner in the 1975 World Cup. He also became the highest individual scorer for New Zealand in ODIs , going past him own record of 189 which he made against England in 2013 .
