SC judgement on Srinivasan 's fate on Thursday New Delhi , 2015/Jan/21 10 : 23 : 00 Text Size Former BCCI president N Srinivasan is facing charges of conflict of interest. © BCCL The Supreme Court will pronounce on Thursday its judgement on various issues including the conflict of interest involving BCCI president-in-exile N Srinivasan in the wake of alleged betting and spot-fixing scandal unearthed during the sixth edition of the Indian Premier League in 2013 . A bench of Justices TS Thakur and FMI Kalifulla on December 17 last year had reserved its verdict on the matter in which several interim directions since August 2013 were passed including the setting up of the three-member committee headed by Justice Mukul Mudgal , former chief justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court . Srinivasan , his son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan , Rajasthan Royals owner Raj Kundra , administrator Sundar Raman among others were probed by the Mudgal committee which had found " some misdemeanour by certain persons " and indicted them in the IPL 6 scandal . The conflict of interest concerning Srinivasan has come under the scrutiny as he was not only the BCCI president but was also the managing director of India Cements , the company which owns the IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings. As per the committee , Srinivasan 's son-in-law was an official associated with the CSK and allegedly placed bets during the IPL . During the pendency of the matter , Srinivasan was asked by the apex court to keep himself away from the affairs of the IPL. When the final report of the Mudgal Committee was opened , the SC had said the identity of the players should not be made public at this stage. The court also did not give details of the indictment or the misdemeanour or the persons involved . © PTI
