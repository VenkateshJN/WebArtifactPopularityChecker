( PTI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 HYDERABAD : Like in the first semifinal , batting was not the best of vocations at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Thursday. But unlike Hobart Hurricanes , who never recovered from a poor start , Chennai Super Kings hung on to give a crowd of 29,478 - the highest so far in Oppo Champions League Twenty20 - something to cheer about - en route to the final . If Kings XI Punjab skipper George Bailey chose to field after seeing how well Kolkata Knight Riders had chased down the target earlier in the day , he had not reckoned with Chennai Super Kings ' ability to innovate and post an imposing 182 for seven. It proved too much for the Kings XI , who were shot out for 117 after losing wickets in a heap and crashed to a 65-run defeat . Brief scores : Chennai Super Kings : 182 for 7 ( Dwayne Bravo 67 , Faf du Plessis 46 , Ravindra Jadeja 27 not out ; Parvinder Awana 4/30 , Akshar Patel 2/30 ) beat Kings XI Punjab by 65 runs ( David Miller 22 , Akshar Patel 31 ; Ashish Nehra 2/9 , Mohit Sharma 2/14 , Pawan Negi 2/28 ) .
