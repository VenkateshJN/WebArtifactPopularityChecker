Dhawan 's form at the top is crucial to India 's fortunes as has been witnessed in this WC . VS WARNER ( M 60 | R 1990 ) - Barring the 178 against Afghans , he has failed to cross the half-century mark in WC. But the southpaw remains a formidable threat thanks to his ability to score big and at a good pace . 2 ) ROHIT ( M 134 | R 4186 ) - Has a good record against Australia as he smashed his maiden ODI double ton against them in Bengaluru in 2013. Backed by some good knocks , Rohit is brimming with confidence right now . VS FINCH ( M 47 | R 1646 ) - The attacking right-hander , barring the 135 against England , has had a quiet tournament. In the semifinal against India , Finch , thanks to his ability to pierce the field , will fancy his chances . 3 ) KOHLI ( M 157 | R 6536 ) - A proven match-winner , Kohli remains the key wicket for the opposition. Blessed with the ability to raise his game during crunch situations , Kohli may well play a starring role on Thursday .

Bats as per the demands of the situation , and can handle pace and spin with ease. Has n't had too many chances to display his ware in the World Cup so far . VS CLARKE ( M 243 | R 7897 ) - The skipper is an experienced player in the Oz line-up. A shrewd cricketer who uses his feet to the spinners and handles the fast bowlers with ease. However , he is not in very good nick . 5 ) RAINA ( M 214 | R 5381 ) - One of the best finishers in the shorter formats of the game. He is a smooth runner between the wickets and can fetch those big boundaries at the death . VS MAXWELL ( M 47 | R 1344 ) - A game changer. Maxwell does n't take much time to make his presence felt. He has the ability to play shots on all parts of the ground . 6 ) JADEJA ( M 118 | R 1737 | Ave 32.77 | W 143 ) - He contributes to the team 's cause with the bat , bowl and in the field.

VS WATSON ( M 185 | R 5656 | Wkts 166 | Ave 31.56 ) - Watson 's fifty in his last outing will give him immense confidence ahead of the semifinals. Remains a top player . 7 ) DHONI ( M 261 | R 8434 | Catch 244 | St 85 ) - The man who can literally finishes off the opposition with his bat. Trust Dhoni to make a crucial mark on the big stage.

VS FAULKNER ( M 42 | Runs 793 | Ave 44.05 | W 54 ) - Is a quintessential limited overs all-rounder who is at his best during the death overs , with both bat and ball . 9 ) SHAMI ( M 46 | W 87 ) - In the absence of an experienced spearhead , Shami has filled in as the lynchpin of India 's bowling attack. And he has done more than a good job . VS JOHNSON ( M 151 | W 234 ) - Has given runs at 5.52 an over in the event , but Johnson can never be counted out. He can strike in the most-important phase of the tournament . 10 ) MOHIT ( M 19 | W 21 ) - Has bowled wicket-to-wicket and made good use of change in pace. On numerous occasions , Mohit has been Dhoni 's go-to man to get those crucial breakthroughs . VS HAZLEWOOD ( M 11 | W 18 ) - His 4-35 helped Australia bowl out Pak for a below par score in their QF. He is a line-and-length bowler who is difficult to put away and will test India . 11 ) UMESH ( M 47 | W 63 ) - Has complemented Shami well with the ball at the start of the innings. Yadav has been incisive and not given much room to the batsmen . VS STARC ( M 39 | W 79 ) - Has troubled the batsmen with his pace and swing. Among the leading wicket-takers in the tournament , Starc also has the best economy rate .
