Last updated on Thursday , 19 March , 2015 16 : 38 IST Total Shares New rules are hurting bowlers : Curtly Ambrose Â© Getty Images Wellington : Legendary West Indies paceman Curtly Ambrose said on Thursday that one-day cricket 's rules favoured batsmen so much that teams might as well use bowling machines to send down deliveries . With the quarter-finals barely begun , there have been 32 centuries at this year 's World Cup , compared to 24 for the entire tournament in 2011. ( Lara , Roberts Back West Indies to beat New Zealand ) Ambrose , who took 225 ODI and 405 Test wickets for the West Indies , said the rules were undermining the contest between bat and ball that was fundamental to cricket 's DNA . " It 's too one-sided an the powers-that-be need to look at this seriously and make it a little more even , because at the moment it 's all about batting , " he told reporters in Wellington ahead of Saturday 's New Zealand-West Indies quarter-final . " The bowlers , they ca n't play cricket. Soon they might have to get in bowling machines. " ( New Zealand Clash is Like Facing Mike Tyson , Claims Darren Sammy ) He said a free hit when there was a no-ball and the batting powerplay meant bowlers could not build pressure to strangle an innings . " Everything favours the batsman , " he said. " A bowler trains hard to do the best for his team , oversteps the front mark and there 's a free hit , the powerplays and all that stuff - I 'm totally not for it . " I believe as a bowler , if you bowl well enough , you can keep it real tight and they ca n't score. ( But now ) all of sudden they 're taking the powerplay and the field moves around so they can score runs. " Ambrose , who was part of the most intimidating pace attack in cricket history , also took aim at sledgers , saying verbally taunting opponents had no place in the game . The Antiguan , who stands at two metres ( six foot seven ) and could silence most foes with a menacing glare , said he never found it necessary to sledge . " I do n't believe in it , I do n't think that sledging is a part of the cricket , " he said , " If you 're a good enough player , you should let the bat or the ball do the talking for you. " Ambrose , who is serving as the West Indies bowling coach at this year 's tournament , conceded his side were underdogs against New Zealand but backed their chances of an upset . " We 've got some dangerous players as well , it just depends what happens on the day , " the 51-year old said , " if we make a good start , blunt their attack early and play to our potential , I believe we have every chance of beating them. " Ambrose said co-hosts New Zealand had to meet home fans ' expectations that they will take their excellent group stage form into the knockout rounds . " That extra pressure could take a toll if they are not strong enough mentally , " he said , " We 're not under pressure. According to cricket pundits we do n't stand a chance , so we 're going to go out there and enjoy our cricket and play to win.
