( PTI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 HYDERABAD : There was no experimentation with the team despite it having already qualified for the semifinals but Gautam Gambhir chose do to something differently . After having successfully chased down targets in three previous games , the Kolkata Knight Riders ' skipper , who is leading for the 100th time in T20s , chose to bat first in what was a dead rubber against the winless Dolphins in their last Group A match of the Oppo CLT20 on Monday night . The result , however , remained the same. The Knight Riders extended their win streak to 13 with a 36-run win and will take on Hurricane Hobarts in the semis on Thursday . Chasing 188 for a win , the Dolphins , who had got the same number of runs against Chennai Super Kings while chasing 243 , tried their best but failed to put the hosts under pressure. However , the visitors provided the sparse crowd some entertainment . Earlier , opener Robin Uthappa made the most of the opportunity to bat first as he stroked his way to an unbeaten 85 ( 55 balls , 13x4 ) and fellow Karnataka mate Manish Pandey provided a lot of fireworks at the end of the innings to help the Knight Riders run up a formidable 187 for two. That laid the foundation for a grand win . Brief Scores : Kolkata Knight Riders 187-2 in 20 overs ( Robin Uthappa 85 not out , Manish Pandey 76 not out ) beat Dolphins 151-8 in 20 overs ( Andile Phehlukwayo 37 , Morne van Wyk 34 ; Sunil Narine 3-33 ) by 36 runs .
