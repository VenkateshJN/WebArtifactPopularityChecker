Page 1 of 4 CHENNAI : The annual general meeting ( AGM ) of the BCCI is likely to be postponed after the Supreme Court 's decision to grant a two-month extension to the Mudgal committee to file its report on the IPL spot-fixing scandal . As per convention , the AGM happens in the last week of September. But with the Supreme Court not allowing N Srinivasan to take charge as president before the Mudgal committee files its report , the delay seems inevitable . Shivlal Yadav is the interim president but board authorities indicated that all accounts have to be signed by the " democratically elected president " . " The BCCI , as per constitution , does n't have the provision for an interim president. Srinivasan has to sign all the documents before it can be placed before the working committee , " a source close to the developments told TOI . Though the Supreme Court posted the case for further hearing on November 2 , it has allowed the committee to file an interim report on any individual if it wishes . There is not a single mention of Srinivasan 's name in Monday 's report and if the Mudgal committee files an interim report giving the ICC chairman the clean chit , the board will be keen to call the working committee meeting as soon as possible . A working committee meeting can be called at a notice of seven days and for calling an AGM , a notice has to be given two weeks in advance .
