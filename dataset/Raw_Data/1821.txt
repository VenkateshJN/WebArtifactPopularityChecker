( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 NEW DELHI : Central Zone spinners , led by captain Piyush Chawla , weaved magic on a helpful track to steer the team to the Duleep Trophy title with a thrilling nine-run triumph over South Zone here on Sunday . Chasing a victory target of 301 , South needed 117 runs on the final day with nine wickets intact. But on a pitch that was offering substantial turn , South lost 7 wickets for 39 runs to hand over the trophy to Chawla and co . From a relatively comfortable 252 for three , they were all out for 291 in 88.4 overs . Spin troika of Chawla ( 3/83 in 20 overs ) , Ali Murtaza ( 3/59 ) and Jalaj Saxena ( 2/44 ) shared the bulk of the spoils but it was Pankaj Singh ( 2/45 ) 's morning spell that started turning the complexion of the game . Out of 13 sessions of play , South dominated 10 but the three dominated by Central turned the course of the game. KL Rahul ( 185 and 130 ) , despite a superb effort , ended on the losing side mainly due to inept shot selection by his teammates . It was an exciting fifth morning where there was a good contest between bat and ball. It turned out to be the best 22-yard strip produced at Feroz Shah Kotla in recent times , by one of the youngest BCCI curator Ankit Datta . The wicket lasted five days with something for everyone from batsman , pacers and spinners . Starting the day at 184 for one , centurion KL Rahul ( 130 ) and Baba Aparajith ( 56 ) played out the first hour before Pankaj Singh struck with old ball . He bowled one that landed on a crack and kept low getting Rahul plumb in-front. The youngster 's innings had played 152 balls hitting 14 fours and five sixes. Dinesh Karthik ( 0 ) bagged a 'pair ' , falling to Pankaj reducing South to 203 for three . Aparajith was unduly subdued today when situation demanded him to play positively as Chawla and Jalaj bowled with a lot of control . Ramaswamy Prasanna ( 29 ) showed a bit of intent by taking on Chawla and Ali Murtaza to inch closer towards the target. The duo added 49 runs as Prasanna was trapped leg before by a Jalaj straighter . Chawla again got his googly right as he enticed Aparajith to come down the track and was promptly stumped. Hanuma Vihari ( 1 ) did n't last long offering a low return catch to Jalaj to become the sixth wicket to fall . R Vinay Kumar ( 24 ) struck some lusty blows before Murtaza bowled him at the stroke of lunch as he played a cross-batted heave . Pragyan Ojha ( 2 ) padded a Chawla flipper while Abhimanyu Mithun was cleaned up by Murtaza to make it 289 for 9 . Shreyash Gopal could n't keep his cool as he jumped out to Murtaza to be stumped by Naman Ojha , sparking off wild celebrations by jubilant Central players . Brief Scores : Central Zone 276 & 403. South Zone 379 and 291 in 88.3 overs ( KL Rahul 130 , Piyush Vhawla 3/83 , Ali Murtaza 3/59 ) . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
