World Cup 2015 : Sri Lanka March 3 , 2015 Seekkuge Prasanna to be flown in as cover for Herath 48 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Comment shares 48 Rangana Herath split his spinning finger while trying to take a return chance against England on Sunday © AFP Legspinning allrounder Seekkuge Prasanna will be flown to Australia as cover for the injured Rangana Herath , SLC has said. Herath required four stitches on his spinning finger , which was split as he attempted to take a return chance off Jos Buttler in the 49th over of England 's innings on Sunday . He was withdrawn from the attack , and has since been assessed by doctors in both New Zealand and in Sydney , where the team arrived on Monday . " Rangana 's wound is expected take 7-10 days to heal , " an official release said. " Seekkuge will be sent to Australia only as a precautionary measure. " The injury puts Herath in doubt for the match against Australia on Sunday , but he is not necessarily ruled out yet. Prasanna 's forthcoming arrival in Australia will not affect the squad unless Herath 's injury is serious enough to rule him out of the tournament. Prasanna can not , for example , come into the squad for the Australia match , then leave it again when Herath regains fitness . Prasanna most recently played for Sri Lanka in the last of their ODIs against New Zealand . He took 1 for 30 from 9.2 overs in that match , and has since been playing domestic cricket in Sri Lanka .
