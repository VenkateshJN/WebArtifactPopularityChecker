Jadhav , 35 , will play his 100th first-class match when he leads Assam against Goa at Porvorim in the Ranji Trophy Group C ( plate division ) match . He lost his father at the age of 15. Living in Chembur post the Babri Masjid riots , he saw the fear and turmoil of violence from close distance. So , despite representing Mumbai in U-16 cricket , he decided to shift to safer Pune with his mother. Having close relatives staying here was also a factor . He was with Maharashtra for eight seasons in the Ranji Trophy and made it to the India 'A ' team. He was even a part of India reserves that played Australia in 2004-05. But he missed out on the Mumbai Test of the series by a whisker. He was with Pune Warriors team in IPL but never got a game .
