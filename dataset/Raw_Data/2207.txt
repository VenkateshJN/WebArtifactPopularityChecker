( PTI Photo ) RELATED NEW DELHI : After starting IPL 7 with a win , Rajasthan Royals seem to have gone off track with back-to-back losses at the hands of Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings. However , all-rounder Rajat Bhatia feels it 's still early days in the tournament and there is nothing to worry about . " Right now we can afford to make mistakes. It 's better than making mistakes at a later stage. We can learn from our shortcomings and work on them. There is no panic situation in the team. It 's still early days and I am sure we will do well in the upcoming matches , " said Bhatia , speaking to TOI from Dubai on Thursday . Talking about their loss to Chennai Super Kings by seven runs on Wednesday , he said , " That pitch was a little difficult to bat on and I think our players played in a hurried manner. It was difficult to score runs. " Bhatia ( 2/13 ) troubled the batsmen with his slower ones and played a crucial role in restricting Chennai to 140. " I like to use a lot of variation in my bowling and that pitch suited my style of bowling. I used the conditions to my advantage , " he said . Bhatia is happy with his form and said he would like to keep it that way. " It 's a new season and a new team for me. If I want to cement my place in the team then I have to keep performing. Currently , I am satisfied and happy with my form. I want to bowl consistently. My batting has been good so that is a plus point , " said Bhatia . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Rajat Bhatia,Rajasthan Royals,Kings XI Punjab,IPL,Chennai Super Kings Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
