Sharad Pawar will attend AGM , may contest The author has posted comments on this article TNN | Feb 1 , 2015 , 10.36AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 MUMBAI : Mumbai 's strongman Sharad Pawar has set the ball rolling in a bid to return as the Indian cricket board 's president. TOI has reliably learnt that the former Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) chief will represent the Mumbai Cricket Association in the board 's annual general meeting , mandated to be held within six weeks of the SC ruling on January 22. Pawar 's presence could mean he is preparing to jump in the fray . Knowing his track record , Pawar will declare his intentions only when he is absolutely sure that he will emerge victorious. " We will get to know if he will contest or not , only at the last minute , " a source close to the developments said. Pawar told the MCA he would be going for the AGM shortly after the SC made it impossible for Srinivasan to contest . Pawar was BCCI president from 2005-2008 and ICC president from 2010 to 2012 . Ironically , if the Srinivasan camp does n't relent , Pawar may find himself pitted against Jagmohan Dalmiya , just like he was in 2005. Just like that epic battle , he is expected to be backed by Vidarbha 's Shashank Manohar and Punjab 's IS Bindra . Together , they are likely to get support from associations in the west and central zones while south and east may still stay behind Srinivasan 's choice .
