on February 4 , 2015 , 12 : 38 GMT Gilly never failed to excite us throughput his whole career. # adamgilchrist Master_Mihil on February 4 , 2015 , 4 : 32 GMT I still think if the weather was good we could have won it.. At the final stages.. last four five overs they could barely see the ball so they only allowed spin. SL team was rushed without giving any set score they panicked trying to up the run rate in terribly poor light. Aussies thought they were the best in 1996 as well. But we defeated them. 218 for 8 two overs remaining when they could n't barely see the ball ? you know what batsmen can do last few overs right ? ....Insipid west indies organizers and pathetic umpires awarded the cup to Aussies the cup that day.. a match never happened. . KingOwl on February 2 , 2015 , 18 : 12 GMT It was a great inning. An exceptional inning and a lucky inning when you think of the rest of the batters ' performances. Everything went his way. And when it does for a player of the caliber of Gilchrist , there is nothing the opposition can do. I think SL just had no luck and they needed some to beat a strong Aussie team . on January 28 , 2015 , 3 : 57 GMT yah it was a great knock that stunned every cricket lover except lankans.. . Wazy_Akrim on January 28 , 2015 , 1 : 53 GMT This World Cup was a bit of a fiasco , to be honest , dragging on for far too long.The right team definitely won , smashing all in their path. I agree that the Sri Lankans ' had a pretty decent team , but they really were a distant second to a far superior team. Gilly 's knock in the final was one for the ages. His World Cup record of three from three is unlikely to be matched by anyone not playing for Australia . Charindra on January 28 , 2015 , 0 : 19 GMT I remember watching this , and my hopes rapidly dissolving with every boundary hit by Gilchrist. I do n't think we were too bad in that game , and the next best score in the Aus innings was 38. It was just exceptional batting , and it came off for him that day . drinks.break on January 28 , 2015 , 0 : 14 GMT @ Stoort & Tajy , the reason you ca n't see footage - and you have never been able to see footage on this site - is that ESPN has never had the rights to it. That 's the brutal reality of professional sport - if you want to see the action you have to pay for it . Even the cricinfo comms do n't come live from the ground , but just relay in words what the commentators are seeing on TV on the other side of the world ( with maybe the odd extra observation from one of the comms team who might happen to be at the ground ) . itsrajas on January 28 , 2015 , 0 : 00 GMT they should include footage.. otherwise just the talk is boring on January 27 , 2015 , 13 : 59 GMT 96 SL team might have won the the cup but to me 2007 team best SL team that ever played a world cup and they deserved win that TAJY on January 27 , 2015 , 13 : 31 GMT AMEN to STOORT. I am trying to figure out the same thing. Why ca n't I view highlights of the game ? ? I 've been trying to get highlights of the WI vs South Africa game for the longest of times and i ca n't see it anywhere , not even on Youtube ( likely pulled for legal reasons ) .
