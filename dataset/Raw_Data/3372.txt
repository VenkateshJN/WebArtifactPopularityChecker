Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 The 21-year-old Cummins suffered a slight side strain in Australia 's one-wicket defeat to New Zealand but had been cleared of serious injury . " At this stage , Pat is unavailable for selection for tomorrow 's game , " Clarke told reporters in Perth on Tuesday . Selectors have yet to decide on the 11 to take on non-Test playing nation Afghanistan , Clarke added , saying they needed to see how the team recovered from Tuesday 's training . Batsman Steven Smith was struck on the hand in the nets on Tuesday , but returned for another bat and was available for selection , Clarke added . Cummins ' injury opens the door for Josh Hazlewood to join left-armers Mitchell Starc and Mitchell Johnson on the WACA 's fast and bouncy wicket . The 24-year-old Hazlewood was replaced by Cummins after going wicketless in the big win over England in their World Cup opener in Melbourne . Fast-bowling all-rounder James Faulkner has also declared himself fit for his first World Cup match after recovering from a side strain , placing further pressure on the misfiring Shane Watson . If Watson was left out of the side it would likely mean a promotion for Smith to the all-rounder 's number three position in the batting order , with Faulkner and Mitchell Marsh to bat lower down . Australia are keen to hit back against minnows Afghanistan after the narrow defeat to New Zealand , which came after their second match against Bangladesh was washed out .
