Australia v New Zealand , World Cup 2015 , final , March 29 , 2015 March 29 , 2015 Australia , ruining World Cup finals since 1999 ESPNcricinfo staff Comments : 1 | A crowd of 93,013 thronged the MCG for the final. They were treated to a bit of action even before the anthems got underway , with a pitch invader winding his way through the 14 participating teams ' flags spread across the # MCGsobig outfield . — Andrew Fernando ( @ andrewffernando ) March 29 , 2015 New Zealand had won the toss and decided to bat , and that , as per popular opinion , evened the odds in their favour . Teams batting 1st at the MCG in this World Cup have scored 300 + in each of the 4 games , and won by 90 + runs. http : //t.co/MZmHkVal7q — S Rajesh ( @ rajeshstats ) March 29 , 2015 Mitchell Starc did not quite agree , sending down the near-perfect opening over. As good as Starc was , Brendon McCullum was equally bad . — Daniel Brettig ( @ danbrettig ) March 29 , 2015 Not one of Brendon 's finest innings : three wafts , no contact and bowled by Starc. NZ 1-1 — Ali Allahditta ( @ AliAllahDitta ) March 29 , 2015 It was time for some calm to be injected into the innings. There was a little too much calm though , with Kane Williamson and Martin Guptill scoring at around three to the over . NZ on course to get through to lunch without further loss. # CWC15Final # AUSvNZ — Greg Baum ( @ GregBaum ) March 29 , 2015 The time since our last run and the time it takes the ball to reach the boundary must be about the same. # MCGsobig — Grace ( @ missgracenz ) March 29 , 2015 The pair survived the stick - Australia 's pacy trio of Josh Hazlewood , and Mitchells Starc and Johnson - but fell prey to the carrot dangled by Michael Clarke : the gentle offspin of Glenn Maxwell. And Guptill got quite the sendoff too , from Brad Haddin , the first of many verbal displays from Australia . @ ajarrodkimber I think he was bamboozled by how bad that delivery was . — Michael Wagener ( @ Mykuhl ) March 29 , 2015 Bet Guptill really appreciated Haddin 's commentary on his dismissal.. . — Lawrence Booth ( @ the_topspin ) March 29 , 2015 Williamson went soon after . # MCGsobig Williamson tries a six down the ground and he 's caught and bowled by Mitchell Johnson # CWC15Final # AUSvNZ — Vishal Dikshit ( @ Vishal1686 ) March 29 , 2015 Same old cricket story then ? Australia. Reminding kids that life is cruel and unforgiving since 1877 . — Karthik Krishnaswamy ( @ the_kk ) March 29 , 2015 Australia. Ruining World Cup finals since 1999. # AUSvNZ # CWC15 — Dan Liebke ( @ LiebCricket ) March 29 , 2015 Not if Grant Elliott had his way. For the second time in two big games , the , umm , South Africa-born cricketer player held his nerve expertly . Normal human body temperature : 37 ° Grant Elliott body temperature : 0 ° MS Dhoni body temperature : -37 ° # IceMen # CWC15 # AusvNZ # Aus # NZ — Freddie Wilde ( @ fwildecricket ) March 29 , 2015 If Elliott wins this World Cup maybe we could sneak in a cheeky little Joburg tickertape day ? — Rob Houwing ( @ RobHouwing ) March 29 , 2015 He even conquered the biggest , baddest cricket ground of them all with a mis-hit ( much like Guptill earlier in the day ) . # MCGsobig top edges only carry into the 10th row . — Jimmy Neesham ( @ JimmyNeesh ) March 29 , 2015 But New Zealand were yet to face that lethal wicket-taker : the batting Powerplay. In the blink of an eye , Ross Taylor , Corey Anderson and Luke Ronchi were gone . Coriander has been chopped. # CWC15 — Gaurav Sabnis ( @ gauravsabnis ) March 29 , 2015 When growing up in Aus , maybe Ronchi dreamed of being cheered to the rafters at the MCG in a World Cup final. It 's happened. He 's out for 0 . — Andy Zaltzman ( @ ZaltzCricket ) March 29 , 2015 Kiwis have lost 3-1 in this Power Play. Probably out of respect for Earth Hour — Peter Lalor ( @ plalor ) March 29 , 2015 Powerplay has made Kiwis utterly powerless.. . New Zealand never recovered. A less-fancied team bowled out for 183 against one of the giants of world cricket. Some thought that was reason enough to be optimistic . Just going to post this for no real reason : http : //t.co/Vv9ri86519 # CWC15Final ^ RI
