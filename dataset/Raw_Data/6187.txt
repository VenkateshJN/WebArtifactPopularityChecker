Please give a youngster a chance and at least give him half the chances that Afridi got . Posted by DealOrNoDeal on ( October 16 , 2014 , 14 : 22 GMT ) I think we all have forgot that Hafeez was vice captain for so long but he decided to quit. How can you make someone a captain when he does not even want it. Afridi should be out of the team and show his aggression in domestic cricket . Posted by on ( October 16 , 2014 , 13 : 39 GMT ) I am utterly against Mohammad Hafeez as a batting all-rounder in team ( playing up the order on non-asian pitches ) but we have to acknowledge that he is the one who has more knowledge about players and knows when and where to use them properly. He has an edge over Afridi and Misbah when it comes to leading the side. But , changing captain at this moment would n't be good for PAK team . Posted by on ( October 16 , 2014 , 7 : 58 GMT ) Whether you like it or not. Unfortunately , Misbah is the captain for World cup 2015. Fingers crossed @ # ! Posted by on ( October 16 , 2014 , 5 : 37 GMT ) I thing Ahmed Shehzad should be the Captain for upcoming World Cup..... PCB should look for a combinations of calmness and aggression . Posted by ModernUmpiresPlz on ( October 15 , 2014 , 23 : 30 GMT ) I vote for Younis . Posted by dhmts on ( October 15 , 2014 , 15 : 31 GMT ) Great cartoon. Good to see stuff from outside India. : ) Posted by Captain_Tuk_Tuk on ( October 15 , 2014 , 14 : 25 GMT ) Great cartoon Afridi is aggressive captain and Misbah is defensive : P P.S Afridi should be the captain for upcoming world cup . Posted by on ( October 15 , 2014 , 14 : 04 GMT ) Every one 's vote si for Misbah...one who really knows the cricket will undestand.. ! Posted by naansari on ( October 15 , 2014 , 13 : 49 GMT ) Really it 's a great effort from Satish for coming out with such an exceptional skill...As for the captaincy is concerned it will better if Mishab lead the team because Afridi is not capable for this position . MORE CARTOONS
