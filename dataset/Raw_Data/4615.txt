Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 | Match in Pics " I 've never got a four-for before. It was running on my mind a bit but I was focussing on my basics and it was coming out well. I bowl at such phases of the game , it 's more of cutting the runs out , it can get a little difficult , " said Ashwin . Player of the match @ ashwinravi99 has a very special message for # IND fans following today 's win over # UAE ! https : //t.co/XnWRn1ygCO # INDvUAE â€” Cricket World Cup ( @ cricketworldcup ) February 28 , 2015 " When it comes to this format , I 'm pretty much unselfish. It does n't matter if I get the numbers or not as long as I put in the effort required. I enjoyed bowling here the last time I bowled against Sri Lanka. It helps if you bowl it slower and there 's a wee bit of turn as well. " The 28-year-old explained he persisted with his tactics . " If you set the batsman well , mixing up the arm ball , and then you bowl one really slow , you are going to get him fending it and leg slip comes into play , " he said . " My wrist is getting into a good position and that helps with the arm ball , the breeze helped as well. It was good to play the big teams initially , now we 're on a roll. " The Chennai-born added that they are peaking at the right time after dismal performances in the tour Down Under where they failed to win a single game . " We always peak well coming into tournaments. We had a tough Test series and did n't do too well in the tri-series as well. But we always knew we would pick it up when we came into the World Cup , " concluded Ashwin .
