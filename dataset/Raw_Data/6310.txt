Five of the most bizarre List A scorecards of 2014 shares 1 Four tons , 800 runs in all , 399 chased down What led Ben Dunk to his T20 international debut in November was not enough to put up a match-winning total. His 229 not out off 157 balls , with 15 fours and 13 sixes , should have demoralised any team. Not Queensland. Tasmania used only three batsmen to score 398 , a total many would consider insurmountable. Not Queensland. An opening stand of 280 in 35.2 overs , with Usman Khawaja 's 166 off 110 and Chris Hartley 's 142 off 120 led them home. With 16 balls to spare . Kent 383 , Somerset 371. Kent won by two runs In one of the high-scoring matches of the year , Somerset fell short of their revised target of 374 by only two runs , after Kent scored a staggering 383. Two Kent batsmen scored hundreds. Somerset put up a tough fight , despite needing 223 from the last 20 overs with five wickets in hand. The most peculiar feature was that not a single Somerset batsman crossed 56. Three got fifties , one got an unbeaten 49 , and eight scored in double-digits . Unbeaten hundred , five-for in nine overs. Not enough ? There have been many cases of a player making a hundred and taking a five-for in the same match. But how often is he the only one to make a substantial score and take more than one wicket ? When Kerala played Hyderabad in the Vijay Hazare Trophy in November , Ashish Reddy 's 5 for 30 in nine overs could not stop Kerala from scoring 321. No other bowler conceded less than six an over. And in reply , no Hyderabad batsman could score more than 27 , made by the No. 11 , Reddy , who walloped an unbeaten 119 from 107 balls with nine fours and eight sixes. Much to his dismay , his side lost by a massive 133 runs . 367. For no loss Batsmen are a greedy lot and Morne van Wyk and Cameron Delport proved how much in South Africa 's Momentum Cup tournament. Van Wyk racked up 175 off 171 , Delport 169 off 130 , and the total stood an unblemished 367 for 0. Move over , Tendulkar and Dravid. There 's a new top List A partnership in town. But that might have ended up as mere consolation as Knights opener Reeza Hendricks , unbelievably , hit the highest score of the match - 181 off 135. Dolphins ' nerves lurched as Rudi Second added 107 as well , but the next highest was a mere 12 runs and van Wyk and Delport eventually ended up on the winning side. By only 25 runs . A century in boundaries A list of bizarre scorecards without a mention of Pakistan domestic cricket ? No way. In the President 's Cup Shahzaib Hasan hunted down 148 runs for Port Qasim Authority in 12.2 overs. He slammed 112 off 44 balls and needed to run only eight , as 104 came in boundaries. He smashed 11 fours - the whole State Bank of Pakistan team got only 12 - and 10 sixes , which was 10 times as much as the opposition . Honourable Mentions
