OLDEST jackiethepen on April 9 , 2015 , 22 : 35 GMT If they appoint Vaughan then we know nothing has changed. It 's jobs for the boys , just different boys.

He is level headed , well spoken and manages " difficult " players very well . mautan on April 8 , 2015 , 20 : 54 GMT Agree with a lot of comments supporting Naseer Hussian...excellent captain..probably the best ever considering that he got the team as a terrible unit. He was singlehandedly responsible for making England team tough like the aussies. It was his hard work for 5 years that culminated in Ashes victory of 2005. Reversely , Vaughan got the team on a huge up , got a batsman like Peitersen and Strauss , and still left the team as a weak unit. Hussian was so involved , that it affected his batting. He was so consumed by captaining England to glory that it took a toll. If he had a good team with some stars , they would have been world beaters under him . on April 8 , 2015 , 20 : 49 GMT I thought this has happened a long time ago. Good for England and English cricket. Go Paul go and never return . JG2704 on April 8 , 2015 , 20 : 40 GMT Ca n't say I 'm sad about Downton leaving. He seemed to be the instigator in getting rid of KP and while I 'm not convinced KP would do a similar job today as he did yesteryear , the whole affair was really poorly handled. Even if they wanted KP out they could have given him time off and as it happened he 'd have found it hard to get back in anyway. Also , I reckon it 's more than just coincidence - and suggested this at the time when KP committed himself to play for Surrey - that he knew something we did n't. Ca n't see any way KP gets back in under Downton/Moores. Under Vaughan ( if the rebadged job goes to him ) and an other it becomes much more possible nursery_ender on April 8 , 2015 , 20 : 33 GMT IDDO - are you seriously saying Botham was a better captain than anyone ? England did n't win a test under his captaincy, JimmyL on April 8 , 2015 , 20 : 23 GMT " I do n't know what you were watching in the 1990 's when Hussain was captain but England lost nearly every game. Hussain was the captain when England were at the bottom of every ranking " - IDDO555 What ? ? ? ? ? ? IDDO555 ? Were you actually born when Nasser Hussain was Captain ? Yes , England were bottom of the rankings when he took over as captain. He got a hospital pass ( much as whoever evetually takes over from the wreckage of Alastair Cook 's captaincy will ) . He was handed a team that had a culture of losing , was ill-disciplined , was always less than the sum of its parts - and by sheer force of personality and will ( along with not-inconsiderable tactical nous and a significant contribution with the bat ) moulded the team into one that started to learn how to win again. He was the John the Baptist for Michael Vaughan 's 2005 Ashes team - and one of England 's finest captains . JimmyL on April 8 , 2015 , 20 : 12 GMT What a stitch-up ! They abolish the post , rather than give Downton the sacking he deserves , which makes him technically " redundant " , and thus gives a figleaf of justification for the masive payout he 'll no doubt receive. Meanwhile , because it was a redundancy and not a sacking , it 'll be " move along , nothng to see here - nobody 's getting sacked here - and Cook and Moores are even more impregnable..... " FieryFerg on April 8 , 2015 , 20 : 11 GMT Please do n't let them even consider Flower for this new post. We need to get rid of his dour , joyless , pre-ordained brand of cricket. On recent evidence best candidate might be Colly but he wo n't get a look-in I suspect . on April 8 , 2015 , 20 : 02 GMT Right , well that 's sorted. Now would Tom Harrison be kind enough to arrange for Adam Lyth to open the innings ? SirViv1973 on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 58 GMT He was completely out of his depth and i 'm glad he 's gone. I hope Moores & Whittaker follow soon. I think the whole structure needs to be looked at. I think the team does need a manager as well as a top class coach but I would like the selection process to be modernized. If we have a manager/DOC then he should be the one picking the team with assistance from the coach. There is no need what so ever to have the a panel of selectors. Of the current gang that are responsible for selection , neither Moores or Newell played int cricket & all whittaker managed was 12th man duties on an ashes tour 30 years ago , Fraser is the only one who played any test cricket ! Harris652 on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 55 GMT @ IDDO555 - Hussain actually captained England in just a handful of tests in the 1990s. As for the 'worst captain in 50 years ' claim , Stewart , Atherton , Flintoff , Gower , Gooch , Botham and Greig all have inferior records. http : //stats.espncricinfo.com/england/engine/records/individual/list_captains.html ? class = 1 ; id = 1 ; type = team on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 47 GMT @ IDDO555....nonsense post....Hussain had a decent record as captain , 17 wins & 15 defeats in 45 tests as captain , not the worst in the past 50 years , do some proper research ! ! ...He only captained one series in the 90 's , and that was against NZ at home which Eng lost 2-1....following the subsequent series against SA , he went on to captain series wins against the WI ( the first series win against the WI in decades ) , away against Pakistan & Sri lanka ( no mean feat against the likes of Waqar , Wasim , Mushtaq , Inzi , M Yousuf , Sangakarra , Jayasuria , Vaas , Murali to name a few....so please research before posting absolute nonsense....please publish Iddo555 on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 47 GMT Bob raises a good point , rather than who to appoint in a position the question should be is the position needed ? There seems to be too many people who seem to have a job and title without people knowing what they actually do and whether they are even needed . We need a pyramid system that works , from grass roots to the England test and one day team because it seems to me the structure from top to bottom is broken and has been for a while , too much money spent on on management wages and not enough on grass roots cricket on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 42 GMT Better late than never ! . Good riddance ! . agol on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 42 GMT IDDO555 - that is completely rubbish about Hussain. Worse than Gower ? Gatting ? Botham ? Gooch ? Stewart ? A captain who led us to wins in Sri Lanka and Pakistan , home wins over India and Windies ? Hussain got us up off the mat and fighting again. Then Vaughan and the others after him took us on to the next level. This nonsense is a grave disservice to a fine captain and a key figure in modern English cricket 's revival . ashes267 on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 30 GMT I m an Indian but I think that hussein was the best English captain I have ever seen.... problem with English team is that they try too much... they just let the things to go by their own way... even I do n't agree with sacking Cook... Kevin was n't a good player.... n I am talking from a neutral point.... let there be only one coach or simply no coach at all... as no coach ca n't go in the middle n play for u.. . riaz.m on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 11 GMT What a shambles it has been now for over 12 months at ECB. It only remains for KP to be named " England Supremo " i.e. captain/coach/coach driver....... . bobmartin on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 10 GMT Lots of talk here about the pros and cons of ex-England captains Atherton , Hussain and Vaughan.. as Director of Cricket.. when the question ought to be " Do we need one ? " .... What on earth influence can he have on the way the team plays. We would be better scouring the world for a first class coach with proven ability.. and offer him the no doubt outrageous salary a DoC would command... That 's the way forward. Have we not learned anything from the Aussies.... Look at the turnaround in that team since they appointed Lehmann...That 's the sort of guy we need... Let 's have some good old -fashioned common sense and plain speaking... and less talking in cliches and making excuses. . Patchmaster on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 28 GMT Moores surely is next on the list ? I think Graves is a super sensible guy and hopefully his intelligence will spill over into the selectors arena , as we have a huge problem there , and without picking the right players we have zero hope of being a decent side again . Nutcutlet on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 26 GMT Out of touch , a poor judge of a man 's ability to do the key jobs ( coach and captain ) , Paul Downton can return to the world from whence he came. This is only the first tremors of the 'quake that is going to shake the dead wood out of the highest echelon of England 's cricket. And , behind it all , lies the judgement of he ( or they ) who identified Downton as 'the right man for the job'. They should walk before they are pushed. And everyone who follows English cricket knows who they are. How can they continue ? neil99 on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 22 GMT Check. Nothing has changed - the new role of " Director of England Cricket " proves this , which is yet another highly paid , meaningless role. Wisden has it spot on . on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 18 GMT No mention of trying to be the top test cricket nation again I see. Still obsessed with the world cup I suppose. But why not concentrate on something we have a sporting chance of one day regaining ? We 're short of classy one dayers . 200ondebut on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 18 GMT Good news for English cricket. Just need to get rid of Moores and we might have a chance of regaining former glories . jackiethepen on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 09 GMT If they appoint Vaughan then we know nothing has changed. It 's jobs for the boys , just different boys. Vaughan was a good player but his pronouncements since retiring have been consistently fluctuating , hyperbolic and often wrong.

Finally ECB gets rid of the menace that caused all the trouble in the past 15 months. The damage that Downton has caused - starting from getting rid of Gooch and KP - will take a while to be repaired. But hats off to Colin Graves for taking this bold decision. Next step should be to get rid of Moores ! EVH316 on April 8 , 2015 , 17 : 03 GMT He was fortunate to keep it after his ridiculous first few months ( KP - both the ludicrous muscle-flex of the sacking itself , and inability to keep quiet about it ; but even more the appointment of Moores as " the best coach of his generation " ) .
