All-round Faulkner powers RR to victory Fri , Apr 10 2015 by Vineet Ramakrishnan Last updated on Friday , 10 April , 2015 , 07 : 50 PM James Faulkner picked 3 for 26 after hitting 46 off 33 balls to help RR beat KXIP by 6 runs. © BCCL It was in the 19th over of the Rajasthan Royals innings that James Faulkner , batting on 26 off 26 balls , decided to take on his Australian team-mate Mitchell Johnson with the team total on 138 for 6 , and the allrounder succeeded in taking 19 runs to help his team to a competitive total of 162 for 7. Prior to that over , Kings XI Punjab had enjoyed the upper hand throughout , after winning the toss , at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium , Pune , courtesy a superb bowling performance by the fast bowlers. Cut to the 19th over of KXIP innings ; the IPL 2014 finalist had reached 122 for 6 in the run chase , when Faulkner came on to bowl the decisive over. He gave away just nine runs and more importantly , removed Mitchell Johnson and George Bailey to help script his team 's first win of the season by 26 runs . After losing half their side for just 76 runs by the 11th over , RR were under the pump when IPL debutant Deepak Hooda ( 30 ) and Faulkner ( 46 ) got together for a quick-fire 51-run stand to give the RR innings some momentum , and Faulkner ensured that his team went into the break on a high , despite Anureet Singh 's fantastic spell of 4-0-23-3 . RR bowlers backed up Faulkner 's good work and had KXIP in a spot of bother at 46 for 3 , including the wickets of Virender Sehwag - golden duck and Glenn Maxwell , taken by Faulkner himself. KXIP fought hard led by Murali Vijay , but as has been the case with RR , their sublime fielding once again came to the fore and made the difference in the end . Vijay was timing the ball immaculately and had moved to 37 off 32 balls before a smart piece of fielding by young Sanju Samson sent back the India international. After hitting the stumps to remove Wriddiman Saha , Samson threw an under-arm direct hit on the move to dismiss Vijay. Sandwiched between these two efforts was a stupendous catch from Tim Southee at mid-off to remove the dangerous Maxwell for 7. Southee was not done yet and in the 19th over , played a huge role in dismissing Bailey. The KXIP skipper had hoisted Faulkner towards the long-on fence and as the ball seemed to be crossing the ropes Southee leapt to grab the ball and flicked it in before hitting the ground. The relay catch was completed by Karun Nair who held on to a sharp return from Southee as KXIP 's hopes of winning the tie died down . Axar Patel ( 24 ) , David Miller ( 23 ) and Bailey ( 24 ) played handy knocks , but a disciplined bowling in the middle overs by Pravin Tambe ( 3-0-15-0 ) , Dhawal Kulkarni ( 3-0-21-1 ) , Stuart Binny ( 2-0-15-0 ) and Faulkner ( 4-0-26-3 ) meant that the explosive KXIP batting line-up was kept under check , as they finished with 136 for 8 in their allotted 20 overs . Earlier , after winning the toss the young pacers of KXIP Sandeep Singh ( 1/19 ) and Anureet Singh ( 3/23 ) had dealt early blows to push RR on the back foot , before Johnson ( 2/34 ) did his bit with the ball . With enough swing on offer , the in-swinging duo relished bowling with the new ball and managed to remove Ajinkya Rahane ( 0 ) and Samson ( 5 ) early. While Rahane danced down the track only to slice the wide ball from Singh towards mid-off , Samson was trapped leg before wicket by Sharma. Patel made things worse for RR by cleaning up Karun Nair ( 8 ) , with a flatter delivery . Steven Smith , the stand-in skipper for RR due to Shane Watson 's unavailability owing to a bruised hip , played an enterprising knock of 33 off 23 to steady the innings , but he was scalped by Johnson , introduced only in the ninth over , with a short delivery. The wicket off Stuart Binny ( 13 ) , caught behind , in the same over as Smith 's wicket meant RR were five down for 76 before Hooda and Faulkner resurrected the RR innings . Brief Scores : Rajashan Royals 162 for 7 ( James Faulkner 46 , Deepak Hooda 30 ; Anureet Singh 3/23 ) beat Kings XI Punjab 136 for 8 ( Murali Vijay 37 , George Bailey 24 ; James Faulkner 3/26 ) by 26 runs © Cricbuzz Tags
