Srinivasan The Supreme Court will hear BCCI 's lawyers as N. Srinivasan 's future in Indian cricket administration hangs in balance . Last updated on Wednesday , 26 November , 2014 21 : 37 IST Total Shares File photo of N. Srinivasan . Â© PTI Ever since Supreme Court proceedings on corruption in Indian Premier League started middle of last year , this will be the first time that the case will be heard for the third time in a week. Suspended Board of Control for Cricket in India president N. Srinivasan , who is desperate for another term as Board chief , continues to hog the spotlight even as judges on the special Bench have raised questions on his conflict of interest in Indian cricket . On November 3 , the Justice Mukul Mudgal-headed probe committee submitted a sealed report on 13 individuals. Officially , the judges have revealed the names of four " non-playing " members - Srinivasan , his son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan , IPL COO Sundar Raman and Rajasthan Royals ' co-owner Raj Kundra. On Thursday morning , lawyers will be responding to notices served on their high-profile 'clients. ' ( Meiyappan 's Role in IPL Scam Like Insider Trading : Supreme Court ) The presence of Srinivasan in this case has virtually paled into insignificance the alleged involvement of others. Srinivasan and Meiyappan ( already indicted for betting by the probe panel ) have continued to hog the spotlight because both are directly related to two-time IPL champions Chennai Super Kings. As per IPL rules , the involvement of a team official in corrupt activities can lead to termination. The probe committee has identified Meiyappan as a team official. ( Make Mudgal Report Public : Aditya Verma ) As the case gathers steam on the home stretch , the judges are under pressure to reveal the full report. Cricket Association of Bihar ( petitioners ) counsel Harish Salve , during his two-hour argument on Tuesday , urged the judges -- Justice TS Thakur and Justice FM Kalifullah -- to make the full report public because names of top players were being " maligned " by a speculative media. The judges are not against releasing the entire report but that may not happen immediately. ( Srinivasan 's India Cements Shares Sink as Concerns Over CSK Grow ) This has been a dramatic week and the court has eloquently hinted that it was looking at the overall governance of Indian cricket. By calling BCCI and IPL a " mutual benefit society " , the judges are not amused by the fact that Srinivasan owns an IPL team and also runs the Board. The judges made a telling remark : " Your duty as a president is to keep the show ( IPL ) running and to keep it clean. What is your duty as a team owner ? To win the tournament. " ( IPL Spot-Fixing : A Timeline ) If Monday 's observations are any indication , Srinivasan 's lawyers are up against a wall. To get a clean chit and enable Srinivasan contest the BCCI elections - the twice deferred AGM is scheduled on December 17 - will be their first goal. ( Srinivasan Slammed by Court , Asks 'How Can BCCI Chief Own IPL Team ? ' ) The probe report has charged Srinivasan with " covering up " Meiyappan 's role. The judges said : " We do n't expect people to stand up and confess. There could be corollaries and consequences arising from the inferences contained in the report. That you can not escape. " On Tuesday , the judges event went to the extent of terming Meiyappan 's leaking team information to " insider trading. " ( Srinivasan , Meiyappan Named in Mudgal Report ) Salve is expected to make a strong and steady start and enforce through his argument that " BCCI ( read Srinivasan ) will have to keep their own standards of transparency and cleaning a house. " It could be another long day of exchanges and the odds are clearly stacked against N. Srinivasan and his loyalists. There is unlikely to be one order covering all the " misdemeanours " listed by the probe report. Orders could come in portions and the possibilities could be many.
