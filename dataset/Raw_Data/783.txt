He recalled that even in the 2011 World Cup semi-final at Mohali he had got Sachin Tendulkar out leg before and the decision was overturned on review . " Even at that time I remember Gautam Gambhir telling Sachin not to take a referral as it was a big out yet when the referral was taken it showed the ball going outside the leg-side and this raises lot of questions about this technology.
