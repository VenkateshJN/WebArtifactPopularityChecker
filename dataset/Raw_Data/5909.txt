So , that 's all we have from this game. The semi-finals line-up is out and both games are expected to produce some crazy cricketing moments.

Semi-Final 1 , March 24 : New Zealand vs South Africa , Eden Park , Auckland Semi-Final 2 , March 26 : India vs Australia , Sydney , SCG We had a small sample of tweets during the innings break. Here 's more on what was a day of records at the 'Cake Tin ' : @ ronchi04 : One of the greatest knocks I 've ever seen , amazing work from @ Martyguptill today. Great to get the win , now onto the semi final # goblackcaps . @ MichaelVaughan : The @ BLACKCAPS are a great team to watch ... So aggressive and powerful .. Lead by a great Captain . @ Mykuhl : We will definitely have a first time World Cup finalist. Neither NZ nor SA have been there before . @ sanjaymanjrekar : Absolutely clean hitting from Martin Guptill. Some shots quite breathtaking in front of a great crowd in Wellington . @ fwildecricket : # Aus , # Ind , # NZ and # SA have been the best four teams at this World Cup. They are deserving Semi-Finalists . @ cricketaakash : 643 runs in 80 overs. I 'm assuming people went home happy ! @ scottbstyris : Guptill 's form could be difference between SA and NZ in the semifinals . Martin Guptill enthralled the crowd by playing a whirlwind innings of 237 not out. With his thrill-a-minute knock , he also broke a slew of records. Here 's a collection of all records and some more interesting trivia : Guptill registered the second highest individual score in ODIs. Rohit Sharma is perched at the top of the charts with his spellbinding innings of 264 against Sri Lanka . Guptill is only the second batsman in the history of World Cups to crack a double ton . Gupill went on to break Chris Gayle 's record ( 215 against Zimbabwe in Canberra in this World Cup ) for the highest individual score in World Cups . Guptill is now the first cricketer from New Zealand to notch up a double ton in ODIs Guptill turned out to be the first cricketer from New Zealand to compose back-to-back 100 plus scores in World Cups . This is the second time , Guptill has made consecutive hundred plus scores in ODIs . Guptill also became the second player from New Zealand to notch up a 100 plus score in a knockout game in the history of the World Cup . New Zealand 's score of 393 for 6 is the highest total in a knockout game in World Cups . West Indies became the first team to concede two double hundreds in ODIs . With 26 sixes to his name , Gayle now has smashed the most sixes in a World Cup . With as many as 31 sixes being hammered , this game also saw the most sixes smashed in a World Cup match . In terms of runs , New Zealand 's win ( 143 runs ) is the biggest victory in a knockout game in World Cup history . Curiously , when Rohit cracked a wondrous innings of 264 , he was dropped on four and today too Guptill was dropped on four ! McCullum : 'I think the innings we have witnessed today is probably the best innings I have seen in my life in this form of the game. It was a sublime innings and everyone that was here today will remember it for the rest of their lives. It was just clean striking and it was just a pure class innings. Gups ( Martin Guptill ) been treating for a while , he obviously scored a brilliant hundred in the last game and that innings today is something I will never forget , I am sure everyone everyone here will be the same. The way our team is structured , it allows us a bit of license at the start. Some days it comes off and some days it does n't , but it 's a brand of cricket we are comfortable playing. For us to be competitive against world 's best teams on a regular basis , we got to make sure that we play attacking style of cricket. I think we have seen how much the crowds love the way we 've been playing at the moment and we will continue to play like that ( on being attacking from the word go at the start of the innings ) . We know how dangerous the West Indies players are as well and how clean the strikers they are all the way down the order. The pitch continued to get better and it was a great cricket wicket , but we wanted to make a statement on the back of Gups fantastic innings. We wanted to make a real statement and put in a professional performance across the board. So , that 's what we showed with the ball and in the field as well to back up a brilliant innings and a really good batting performance. Overall , a really good performance from us today. It 's great to be able to progress to the semi-finals and we will enjoy it tonight and celebrate Gups ' success , celebrate the boys ' success and then turn our attention to Auckland . They are a great crowd , the way they have turned up not just in this World Cup , but also through the Test summer and the last couple of years , there has been a tremendous support from the capital. All the fans around the country are really getting in behind this team. The boys thrive on it , it is the greatest time of our lives and it 's great that everyone can join in with us. We will deal with that one in the next couple of days. We just want this to sink in first and certainly not taking it for granted. We will do our homework and we will turn up and put out best foot forward. We will see how we go in the next game , but we are travelling okay at the moment . Well , I gave him no chance to be honest ( on Vettori 's sensational catch ) . You saw the reaction from the boys , the way that they ran from all corners of the ground to celebrate that catch , a guy like him is so instrumental to the performance of this team. He is a legend of New Zealand cricket and still getting that opportunity for us to play with him. He 's such a special man and a special cricketer. For him to pull off something like that today , I think you saw the reaction how much his actions and his involvement in the team means to all of us . I think it is pretty hard to compare eras , there have been some outstanding eras in New Zealand cricket. And certainly the teams I have played in , this is the best team I have been a part of for our country. But certainly not disrespectful to the legends that have been there before for New Zealand cricket. Pretty happy with our lot at the moment , would n't change them for anyone. They have been outstanding , I am sure a few of them are booking their tickets to Auckland as well. I expect a huge crowd in the next game , but thank you everyone for turning up. It 's been a great ride so far. Hopefully , we got another couple of games , but I am pretty sure everyone is enjoying it and we certainly are.' Holder : 'It was tough to defend. I felt we were into the game upto the 35th over. Guptill played a very good innings and obviously we put him down very early and that cost us. It was difficult , a set batsman on that pitch was very dangerous. I thought the ball stood up quite well in the pitch and you had time to place the ball where you wanted. We still did n't hit our yorkers well and that was our downfall today. It 's been a challenge coming from South Africa where we lost 4-1. I always had high hopes coming into the World Cup. We had an up and down roller-coaster ride so far , but it 's been enjoyable. I have learned a lot and it 's something I will never shy away from. It 's just about learning as quickly as possible. The bad days we have , we just need to sit down and assess and find a way where we went wrong. Just try and improve on the next game. The more we dwell on it , the longer it takes to go. We just need to try and apply ourselves a bit more. That 's just it really , for us. Of course , I would like to keep the job ( captaincy ) . That 's something I always wanted to do as a youngster , coming out to lead West Indies. I am here and I do n't think I have done too badly. It has been an up and down ride for me , but I have a lot of confidence going forward in the guys. Hopefully , we can get it right going forward. I would really like to thank the supporters who came all the way from New Zealand to help us and their support is quite appreciated.' Martin Guptill : 'Could n't tell you really ( on what was the thing that put him into overdrive ) . We had a couple of good partnerships early with Kane ( Williamson ) and Ross ( Taylor ) , that really set the game up for us to explode at the end. We were trying to take each ball as it came and just keep rotating the strike. That 's the best way to create partnerships. I thought that we did that pretty well , it worked out for us at the end. I am not really sure , sort of after I got a hundred or so ( on when he thought about going after the bowlers ) . I thought I should probably start hitting a few boundaries at some point. So , it was nice at the end there , Grant ( Elliott ) played a great hand , same with Luke Ronchi as well. That was the quickest outfield I have actually played on here. We got value for shots today and happy to have got a few through the gaps. Incredible crowd here , bit of a step up from the England game. Thanks everyone for coming out and supporting us today. We are going to try. Let this win sink in tonight and then we will focus on the semi-final starting tomorrow. Just try and take it as it comes , but has n't really sunk in yet. We still have got a bit of work to do in this tournament. I ca n't dwell on it too much ( on how cool he was despite scoring a magnificent 237 ) .' Martin Guptill is the Man of the Match for his knock of 237 * The New Zealand camp certainly will be happy with Guptill 's rousing innings as it means there is less pressure on Brendon McCullum to fire at top of the order. They now will take on South Africa in the semi-final in Auckland . Guptill muscled Darren Sammy for a 101-metre six. In the final over of the innings bowled by Russell , he landed a mighty blow that hit the roof and it turned out to be a 110-metre six. In the 38th over , he also smashed Jerome Taylor to shreds by scoring 16 runs. Ross Taylor played his part as well with a handy knock of 42. The Windies certainly would rue the fact that Guptill was dropped in the first over by Samuels. On expected lines , Guptill broke a slew of records. He became only the second batsman to compose a double ton in World Cups. He now holds the record for the highest individual score in World Cups. His innings turned out to be the second highest individual score in ODIs. Guptill became the first player from New Zealand to amass back-to-back 100 plus scores in World Cups. The record for the highest individual score by a New Zealand cricketer is also now in Guptill 's name . Earlier , Guptill scaled fabulous peaks , as his knock of 237 not out turned out to be a masterpiece. With his majestic brilliance , Guptill stunned the opposition into silence and made the Windies attack look utterly clueless. He presented a full face of the bat to play crisply timed shots down the ground against the new ball. Once he reached his century though , Guptill went berserk. The bat came down in audacious arcs as he clouted a listless attack to all corners of the ground . Even when it was raining fours and sixes from Gayle 's bat , it felt like New Zealand had already batted them out of the game , but once he was dismissed , the Windies just hurtled towards a heavy defeat. Jonathan Carter , Marlon Samuels , Darren Sammy , Jason Holder and Andre Russell played breezy knocks , but that just was n't enough on a day when Martin Guptill 's wondrously inspiring innings had put New Zealand in pole position. Among the bowlers , Trent Boult again bowled aggressively by generating swing , and pitched it up and was rewarded with four wickets. Boult has also added another string to his bow as he has a fine bouncer up his sleeve now. The fielding too was sharp. It can be exemplified by how Daniel Vettori showed wonderful judgement at third-man to take a superlative catch as Samuels took a long walk back to the pavilion . Despite Chris Gayle 's blitz at the top of the order , West Indies fell well short of the target. In fact , Gayle waltzed his way to 33-ball 61. It was high-octane stuff from Gayle as he repeatedly targeted the mid-wicket region to hammer hefty blows before Adam Milne knocked over his stumps with a quick delivery. He clobbered as many as eight sixes during his innings . The Kiwis win by a margin of 143 runs , the biggest margin of victory in a World Cup knockout game. New Zealand have been the dominant team by a big margin today. They will now face South Africa in the first semi-final at Auckland. The players walk off the field to a standing ovation from the crowd. The West Indians also walk out to shake hands and congratulate their counterparts . 30.3 Vettori to J Holder , out Caught by Corey Anderson ! !

Bowled ! ! 15.6 Boult to J Carter , no run , back of a length and just outside off , Carter stands tall and pushes it towards short extra cover 15.5 Boult to J Carter , no run , that 's a screamer from Boult , pitched up and nipping away late , draws Carter into the drive before whizzing past the outside edge , did n't miss the off-stump by much 15.4 Boult to J Carter , no run , another well-directed short ball , the line was just outside off as well , Carter went for the pull and missed 15.3 Boult to J Carter , no run , on a good length and on the stumps , Carter watches it all along and defends it back towards the bowler 15.2 Boult to J Carter , FOUR , that 's nicely played !

In particular , Gayle targeted the mid-wicket region to hammer Daniel Vettori for three sixes. It is surprising to note that Brendon McCullum used Vettori with Gayle at the crease. It is risky to try a slow left-arm orthodox against a left-hander , known for playing across the line and smashing sixes over mid-wicket. Gayle also played a wondrous shot on the back foot off Boult for a six over the long-on region. He reached his fifty in just 26 balls. Interestingly , he has mainly scored runs through the on-side. Marlon Samuels looked in good form as well , but Vettori showed outstanding judgment at third man to take a ripper of a catch and send him back to the pavilion. For New Zealand , Boult has again been on the money. He has swung the new ball and more importantly , pitched it up to take four wickets . Johnson Charles looked to take the aggressive route , but it was always going to be an uphill task to take on Trent Boult with the new ball. On expected lines , Boult uprooted his stumps. Lendl Simmons too came out all guns blazing , but was soon caught in the slips by Martin Guptill off Boult. The left-armer 's angle did the trick for Boult . Drinks are on the field now.

Jamie is enjoying every moment from the ground and this is what he has to say - 'Some sizzling batting from Gayle. You can feel those shots around the ground. The crowd 's lapping them up , but no sound has topped the one that emanated after Vettori 's one-handed stunner.' 12.6 Milne to Gayle , no run , on the stumps , defended to mid-off , Gayle lifts his hand up and signals to Carter that the single was not on 12.5 Milne to Gayle , no run , short of length delivery nipping away outside off stump , Gayle looks to defend but gets beaten 12.4 Milne to Gayle , FOUR , it 's a 26-ball fifty for Gayle , who is coming back from injury.

Boult had a big smile on his face on seeing the catch being taken , while Baz was extremely happy as well. The Cake Tin faithful stood and applauded. In fact , someone from the crowd threw an orange shirt behind him , signifying the fact that he deserved a million dollars for that stunner ! Also , the 12th man McClenaghan came out to congratulate Vettori . 10.6 Southee to Gayle , no run , goes round the wicket and bowls a low full toss , Gayle flicks it to mid-wicket 10.5 Southee to Gayle , SIX , do n't bowl length balls to this man when he 's in the mood.

How old is he ? 18 , 20 ? Gee ! Short and outside off stump , Samuels backs away and cuts , does n't bother to keep it down. He was looking to clear the boundary. Vettori at third man was so cool. He watched the ball all the way , just jumped at the right moment. The timing was so important and he 's taken it brilliantly. Can someone give him a million dollars to take a one-handed catch ? After Vettori completed the catch , the entire New Zealand team rushed to his fielding position and mobbed him. Samuels c Vettori b Boult 27 ( 15 ) [ 4s-3 6s-1 ] Boult to Samuels , THATS OUT ! !

Here 's a collection of a few tweets @ mohanstatsman : Highest WC scores... . Gary Kirsten 's 188 * lasted 19y-8d Chris Gayle 's 215 lasted 25 days ! Martin Guptill 237 * for how long ? @ prempanicker : Samuels  who dropped Guptill on 4 - has hit 203 runs in 6 games with 17 fours and 4 sixes. And watched MG hit 23 4s and 11 6s ( 233 runs ) @ rob_zooter : That was an absolute flogging...153 in the last 10 overs and one of the great ODI innings.. # nzvwi @ johnkeypm : Amazing double century by @ Martyguptill , congratulations ! @ cricketaakash : No reverse sweeps , no scoops , no switch hits...Guptil 's 237 has shown that there 's room for some old-fashioned cricket too. Well played . Guptill : " It 's a great feeling. The job is only half done now , we 've got to go out there and finish it off. I thank the crowd for coming in and supporting us. Obviously there is pressure , but you try and put that behind. Luckily , it paid off today. It was good to spend a bit of time out there ( against Bangladesh ) and it was good to play the 50 overs here. It 's a bit tough at the start , but once you get in , you can score freely. " For the West Indies to have any chance of chasing down this mammoth target , they need Gayle to fire on all cylinders. In short , New Zealand will back themselves to win this game . Earlier , McCullum came out all guns blazing , but Holder took an excellent catch off Jerome Taylor to send him back to the pavilion. Runs flowed smoothly from Kane Williamson 's bat before Russell snared his wicket. West Indies also would rue the fact that Marlon Samuels dropped a catch at square leg to give Guptill a reprieve in the very first over of the innings . Once he completed his century , Guptill touched noteworthy crests by playing power-packed shots. In the 38th over , he twinned brilliant wrist-work and power to clout Taylor for 16 runs. By then he had already muscled Darren Sammy for a 101-metre six. He also clobbered Jason Holder for two sixes in the 43rd over and reached his double century in style with a boundary. To put the icing on the cake , the six he smashed off Andre Russell in the final over was a 110-metre six ! Ross Taylor too played his part by playing a useful hand to score 42. Unlike Guptill , Taylor did n't exactly bisect the gaps to send the fielders on a leather hunt. However , it was his partnership with Guptill that helped New Zealand to set the platform for a monstrous total. Once Taylor was dismissed , Grant Elliott played imperious strokes as well . Guptill played with placid calmness at the start of his innings as he looked to present the full face of the bat to collect boundaries straight down the ground. Jerome Taylor bowling half-volleys did n't help West Indies ' cause. Despite losing Brendon McCullum and Kane Williamson , Guptill continued to unfurl a series of boundaries to put more pressure on the opposition . Martin Guptill , with his splendid spread of run-scoring made the opposition camp feel the full weight of his meaty willow to crack a believe-it-or-not innings of 237 not out and take them to a massive total. Guptill with his double hundred broke a slew of records. Guptill turned out to be only the second batsman to crack a double ton in World Cups and broke the record for the highest individual score in World Cups. Interestingly , Chris Gayle 's double hundred also came in this mega event. His knock is the second highest individual score in the history of ODIs. He became the first batsman from New Zealand to compile back-to-back centuries in the history of the World Cup. Guptill scored consecutive hundreds for the second time in his ODI career. He is only the second batsman from his country to amass a score of 100 plus in a knockout game. He now holds the record for the highest individual score by a cricketer from New Zealand as well . Some of the crowd wearing the orange t-shirts bow down to Martin Guptill for his brilliance , while Mrs. Guptill gets very emotional in the stands. He gets a standing ovation now. Phew ! What a knock. So if you are dropped on 4 , you go on to make a double-hundred I guess. Remember , Rohit Sharma was dropped on 4 , when he made 264 at the Eden Gardens a few months ago . 49.6 A Russell to Guptill , 2 runs , fine yorker on the leg stump , Guptill digs it out towards deep mid-wicket , Holder fumbles and they steal a second run as well. Russell is not happy with his captain 's effort and he flicks the bails off at the bowler 's end in anger. Sulieman Benn walk up to Guptill and congratulates him for his knock 49.5 A Russell to Guptill , FOUR , he 's squeezed that out for four ! Full and outside off stump , Guptill drives it over backward point and gets to 235 49.4 A Russell to Guptill , SIX , in the airrrrr and just over Jerome Taylor at long-off. Russell misses the yorker again , bowls it in the slot for the batsman to go big , Guptill does n't try to overhit the ball , just lofts it over long-off 49.3 A Russell to Guptill , 2 runs , full and outside off stump , Guptill drills it to long-off , Vettori races back for the second and that 's great running from the veteran 49.2 A Russell to Guptill , no run , short of length delivery outside off stump , Guptill slogs and misses 49.1 A Russell to Guptill , SIX , oh my word ! He 's hit that onto the roof. A full toss and Guptill smacks it high and handsomely over deep mid-wicket for a 110-metre hit. After that Guptill goes to the non-striker , who pats him on the back. Guptill then realised that he is the second man to hit the ball on the roof at this ground and he signals two to the dressing room to tell them the same thing. He was making that signal to Craig McMillan , the Kiwi batting coach , who was the first man to do so. The camera then focusses on Craig McMillan , who acknowledges the signal and gives a thumbs up to Guptill 48.6 Jerome Taylor to Vettori , FOUR , this is unfair , Daniel Vettori ! He walked right across the stumps , Taylor followed him with a yorker , Vettori tried to flick it , but the ball took the inside edge and went past the stumps to the boundary 48.5 Jerome Taylor to Vettori , FOUR , Vettori gets a four first ball ! Full and in the slot , the slower ball in fact , but not good enough to trouble Vettori , who slogs it through mid-wicket Daniel Vettori , left handed bat , comes to the crease 48.4 Jerome Taylor to Ronchi , out Caught by Benn ! ! Soft dismissal. West Indies hardly celebrate. A fine yorker from Taylor , it was slightly down the leg-side , Ronchi flicks and picks out backward square leg to perfection. Ronchi is livid that he hit it straight to the fielder. Ronchi c Benn b Jerome Taylor 9 ( 5 ) [ 4s-2 ] Jerome Taylor to Ronchi , THATS OUT ! !

West Indies keep offering juicy full balls and Guptill does n't miss out. Slogged hard and over deep mid-wicket 47.1 A Russell to Guptill , FOUR , that 's it ! Sixth double-hundred in ODI cricket and the first New Zealander to do it. This is also the first double-hundred in a World Cup knockout game. What a moment for Guptill. The Cake Tin stands and applauds. His wife is absolutely elated in the stands. What an innings ! Full and outside off stump , Guptill smashes it through mid-off for four. Guptill had his hands aloft as he runs , takes the helmet off and raises his bat to acknowledge the applause. His wife is punching the air in delight and he gets a hug from Ronchi.

The impact was on middle and off and it looked absolutely plumb. The umpire had no hesitation in his mind and Elliott consumed the review as well. Anyway , he 's played a fine cameo. Elliott lbw b Jerome Taylor 27 ( 11 ) [ 4s-2 6s-2 ] Jerome Taylor to Elliott , THATS OUT ! ! Lbw ! ! Elliott has been given OUT LBW , but he 's reviewed it. I think it 's a waste. Looked pretty OUT.

Short ball on the stumps , Guptill pulls and gets away with the edge 45.2 A Russell to Guptill , FOUR , this is lazy stuff from Sulieman Benn ! Surely had to put in the dive.

Short and on the stumps , Elliott goes for the pull and gets an edge , Guptill quickly returns for the third run 44.3 J Holder to Elliott , FOUR , rank long hop and ohhhh dear ! Johnson Charles has overran the ball.

The change of angle does n't work for Holder. He misses the yorker once again and bowls a full ball , it 's in the slot and Guptill slogs it over mid-wicket , deep mid wicket runs to his left and jumps but the ball evades him Holder comes round the wicket Alright ! Six overs to go. Can New Zealand get to 340-350 ? They should be able to get there I guess ! 43.6 A Russell to Elliott , no run , short ball on the stumps , Elliott gets inside the line and pulls , but misses the ball 43.5 A Russell to Elliott , 2 runs , easily guided away to the right of the third man and good running gives Elliott and New Zealand two 43.4 A Russell to Guptill , 1 run , overpitched , but Guptill only manages to flick it along the ground to deep mid-wicket 43.3 A Russell to Elliott , 1 run , sensible stuff from Elliott , just dabs the good length delivery towards gully and gets Guptill back on strike Grant Elliott , right handed bat , comes to the crease 43.2 A Russell to Corey Anderson , out Caught by Gayle ! ! Russell gets another wicket with a slower ball. It was bowled at 122.5kph , Anderson thought it was a length ball and swung early , the ball goes off the toe-end of the bat and goes towards mid-wicket. Gayle moves to his right and jumps a touch to catch it with both hands to his right. West Indies will be happy to see the back of Anderson as he could have done a lot of damage in the last few overs. Corey Anderson c Gayle b A Russell 15 ( 16 ) [ 4s-1 6s-1 ] A Russell to Corey Anderson , THATS OUT ! !

Russell again dug it in short , Corey Anderson was waiting for it and the top edge helps him get a six to deep backward square leg. Brute power from Anderson 41.1 A Russell to Corey Anderson , no run , Corey Anderson is early into the pull and he misses out , Russell bowling short and getting away Andre Russell [ 5.0-0-20-1 ] is back into the attack 40.6 Benn to Guptill , no run , Benn gets away with a poor delivery , it was short and on middle and leg , pulled straight to the fielder at short fine. Either side of the fielder and it was a boundary 40.5 Benn to Corey Anderson , 1 run , fired in and very full on the stumps , drilled to long-on 40.5 Benn to Corey Anderson , wide , fired down leg. Good take by Ramdin 40.4 Benn to Corey Anderson , no run , flicked straight to the fielder at short mid-wicket 40.3 Benn to Guptill , 1 run , 150 for Guptill and he once again shows his bat to someone in the crowd. Could be Mrs Guptill. She is all smiles as she claps. Guptill got there with a cut to the right of point. Can he get to 200 ?

It was driven in front of long-on , Russell was the fielder there , he came charging forward , but the dive from Ross Taylor ensured he made it easy.

In his previous game he had scored a ton against Bangladesh. After a rather poor start , Guptill has found his touch in this World Cup. One striking aspect about his innings is that he has tended to play with a straight bat. The New Zealand camp would also be happy with Taylor scoring runs. With Guptill and Taylor lifting their game , the burden on Brendon McCullum 's shoulders to fire at top of the order has considerably reduced . West Indies ' bowlers struggled to stem the run flow as Martin Guptill and Ross Taylor took advantage of it to check in a slew of boundaries. When bowlers bowl on both sides of the wicket , it becomes difficult for the captain to set a field. Guptill being mainly a front foot player and Taylor looking to play back , it perhaps made it difficult for the bowlers to adjust their lines and lengths. In fact , on occasions , Guptill even pulled and cut on the front foot . Time for a Gatorade break Batting powerplay time 34.6 Samuels to Ross Taylor , no run , dabs it to short third , wants the quick single but it is n't there as Guptill sends him back 34.5 Samuels to Ross Taylor , FOUR , Ross Taylor gets a boundary with a cheeky improvisation.

All is well in the end. It was driven to Carter 's right at point , Guptill was ball-watching as Ross Taylor came near him almost. Carter dived and fielded it , but the ball slipped out of his grasp , then Guptill started to run towards the other end , Ross Taylor too ran back. Guptill saw that and went back to his crease. The throw came in late , by then Guptill had made it back. Comical stuff 32.6 Samuels to Ross Taylor , 2 runs , good running. Turns it with soft hands in front of deep mid-wicket , takes on the fielder and makes it back easily 32.5 Samuels to Guptill , 1 run , Guptill gets a thick inside-edge of sorts on the drive through mid-wicket 32.4 Samuels to Ross Taylor , 1 run , tossed up on the stumps , Ross Taylor nurdles a single to leg 32.3 Samuels to Guptill , 1 run , shuffles across and nudges it through square leg 32.2 Samuels to Guptill , no run , stays back and punches it to point , played with an open face 32.1 Samuels to Guptill , FOUR , drilled !

Had he picked it up it would 've been interesting 31.4 Sammy to Ross Taylor , 1 run , nudged to deep backward square leg , for a single 31.4 Sammy to Ross Taylor , wide , Sammy is appealing for something , but Ramdin was good behind the stumps as he flicked the bails off. Ross Taylor was going nowhere though. Slower delivery down leg , was it a ploy to get Ross Taylor out stumped ? Could well have been. The batsmnan missed the glance , but did n't lift his foot or drag it out 31.3 Sammy to Ross Taylor , no run , turned to short mid-wicket again 31.2 Sammy to Ross Taylor , no run , 'that 's the longest single I have seen not taken ever ' says Sir Ian Botham. Well put Sir Ian. It was pushed to the right of the diving Sammy , who did n't get there. Samuels went to his left from short mid-wicket , tried to boot it and stop it. He did n't too. Ross Taylor and Guptill thought about the single 4 times , decide against it. The ball goes almost till long-on. Sir Ian also reckons they could 've run two for that 31.1 Sammy to Ross Taylor , no run , short of length on the stumps , turned to short mid-wicket 30.6 Samuels to Guptill , no run , driven hard and straight to mid-off 30.5 Samuels to Guptill , no run , nudged to backward square leg 30.4 Samuels to Guptill , 2 runs , did that carry ?

The teams line up for the anthems. " Rally Round the West Indies " is followed by New Zealand 's anthem . Our man , Jamie Alter is at the ground. It 's a big day for the city , which is hosting its first ever World Cup knock-out match and the crowd are ready for all the buzz - " The stadium looks a little more than half full at the moment. Fans still milling in through the turnstiles. Should be a good crowd , " he says . Pitch Report : " This pitch has been used already. The drop-in pitches generally tend to play a lot better the second time around. There 's not much grass on it. It 's flat , it 's been rolled really well. I think it will play terrifically well , a lot of runs. There might be dew later. Batting first , I think they should get 280-300 on the board , " reckons Simon Doull . Teams : West Indies ( Playing XI ) : Chris Gayle , Johnson Charles , Marlon Samuels , Jonathan Carter , Lendl Simmons , Denesh Ramdin ( w ) , Darren Sammy , Andre Russell , Jason Holder ( c ) , Jerome Taylor , Sulieman Benn New Zealand ( Playing XI ) : Brendon McCullum ( c ) , Martin Guptill , Kane Williamson , Ross Taylor , Grant Elliott , Corey Anderson , Luke Ronchi ( w ) , Daniel Vettori , Adam Milne , Tim Southee , Trent Boult New Zealand have won the toss and have opted to bat McCullum : " It 's been a great week , things have really built up as well throughout the week and the anticipation of the New Zealand public as well. The boys are really excited about the opportunity to play in a quarter-final today. We know the challenges the West Indies present but the boys are in a good space and are looking forward to the game. We are going to have a bat first. The wicket looks really good , little bit different to the surface we played England on. Obviously a used wicket as well , so hopefully we will post a good score. I guess that 's one of the reasons. Runs on the board can be quite valuable in these sort of situations. It 's a great atmosphere here today , I 'm sure it will build as the day goes on and if we can get a good score on the board , then we can be desperate in the field later. Adam ( Milne ) is alright. He 'll be fine for this game. He 's looking forward to it. He 's a huge player for us with his ability to bowl fast as well in that third seamer role. He comes in for Mitchell McClenaghan , otherwise an unchanged team. Boys are excited. It is a great place to play when you get such a big crowd turn up and the Wellington public really enjoy following this team as well. So we ca n't wait to get involved. It 's going to be a great day and hopefully we 'll get the result at the end. " Holder : " We 've had an excellent week. We had a few days off when we first got here and then we had three solid days of training , so the guys are ready to go. Not too disappointed ( to lose the toss ) . The wicket is a good wicket and hopefully it should hold up for the entire game and we can get some early wickets. Chris ( Gayle ) is back in , Dwayne Smith misses out. Sulieman Benn comes back in for Kemar Roach. There 's also a thing about Kiwis playing left-arm spin so hopefully we can get some wickets from Benn today. It 's all behind us at the moment. We are pretty much focussed on this game , we are very confident coming into this game. A lot of pressure is on New Zealand to win , obviously in their hometown. So just going to come out and be aggressive and come out with a win. " Brendon McCullum : " We 're not going to get too far in front of ourselves as a group. We know tomorrow will be a tough challenge , and we need to make sure we stand up and plan to execute our skills. " Quotes : Curtly Ambrose , West Indies ' bowling coach : " If we can get a good start , blunt the attack early , then we could be in for a good ball game. " Weather update : No chance of rain. It will be partly cloudy and sunny. A high of 19C is predicted with a humidity of 59 % expected. Should be a good day for playing cricket . Darren Sammy used a famous boxing analogy to describe how his side would go about their task against New Zealand. " It 's a big match , but I remember some guy called Douglas beating Mike Tyson. It 's a case of that on Saturday. We always believed from the time that the tournament started that the first goal was to reach the quarter-finals , and after that you 're two knockout games from a World Cup final. We 've won two. It 's been a long time , but New Zealand has not won any. I watched the guys warm up today and it 's just a different feeling. The dressing room is pumped , I can feel it. It is the business end , you could win all your games in the round matches but come the knockouts , there 's no guarantee that you 're going to win. The guys know what 's at stake and we 're going to do everything in our powers to beat Mike Tyson. " More praise for McCullum 's captaincy comes from former chairman of selectors and board president , Don Neely who feels McCullum is changing New Zealand cricket. " His captaincy is brilliant , " he says. " I 've never seen a New Zealand captain so good. Aggressive field settings , backs his strike bowlers. Courageous. It takes a man with sheer courage to set fields like what we 've seen in some of the games this World Cup , and he has buckets of it. The way he dives into the fence , one day he 'll go through one of them and get his head caught someplace. If you 're fielding for a guy like that you 're bound to be inspired. Fielding is such a big part of the game. McCullum is leading New Zealand into a new era. " Let us have a look at all the noises made by both the teams going into the game. Starting with Brendon McCullum who is a big horse racing fan. He uses a racing analogy to describe the quarter-final. " In horse racing , and I 'm a big horse racing fan , if we miss the start it does n't mean we 're out of the race. I think the horse has never been better , and we 've got every chance in this game to be able to go out there and win even if things are n't a hundred percent. That 's something we probably ca n't say about too many New Zealand teams in the past , that 's encouraging , " said McCullum . Chris Gayle has resorted to taking injections as he fights against time in a bid to be ready for the knock-out stages of the competition. His back problems forced him to miss the final league match against UAE , but indications from the West Indies camp is that he 'll be available for the quarter-final clash. His replacement for the UAE encounter , Johnson Charles , performed credibly and that will mean Dwayne Smith - who has scored a measly 93 runs from 6 innings is the most likely candidate to face the axe. Up against the free stroking New Zealand batsmen , Holder might fancy playing Sulieman Benn , the left-arm orthodox spinner in place of Kemar Roach . Pre-match team news : New Zealand are likely to welcome back Adam Milne to their bowling arsenal. The pacer missed the last league match against Bangladesh with an injured shoulder and should come in for Mitchell McClenaghan . Head-to-Head record : It 's even-stevens as far as World Cup meetings are concerned. The two teams have met each other 6 times and at 3-3 , both teams have shared spoils. Worryingly though for West Indies , their last win over New Zealand in a World Cup game came way back in 1999. They have faced each other only once during the knock-out stages and West Indies took that 1975 clash by a comfortable 5-wicket margin. Does this influence today 's match ? Pitch Conditions : 'Cake Tin ' has had a mixed record this season. There were two big league matches played and there were contrasting results in both of them. England featured in both games - Tim Southee 's sensational 7/33 condemned them to 123 all-out , the lowest score by a Test playing nation in this edition of the World Cup. If that was their lowest ebb , more humiliation was to follow as they failed to defend a more than competitive score of 309 against Sri Lanka - losing by a whopping nine wicket margin. So what can be expected from the pitch for the quarter-final ? It 's anybody 's guess . They now believe that the quarter-finals are a new ball game. One bad day for New Zealand or one good day for West Indies is enough to set the tongues wagging again. It is this belief that makes Holder 's men very dangerous. " Well , you are right ; as you guys put it , we were not supposed to be here , " Sammy said , in his own cheeky manner. But he does n't rule out an upset - saying that the pressure was completely on New Zealand. " We 're not too bad in knockout games. We 're just going to enjoy it , " he added. If there 's one team that turns into a force when they enjoy their game , it is this set of men from the bunch of Central American Islands. So beware , New Zealand . West Indies : If there 's quiet confidence in New Zealand 's camp , there 's more positivity and belief amongst Jason Holder and his men. Unlike New Zealand , West Indies did n't have it all too easy during the group stages. Ireland were no pushovers but their stunning win in the first match left West Indies floundering. If they were hurting inside , the 150-run hammering of Pakistan must have soothed their nerves. If that was convincing , Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels ' show against Zimbabwe brought back the old Caribbean flair. Things looked rosy and West Indies seemed to be back. It was n't a revival though ; they were hammered for 408 by AB de Villiers & Co. in their very next encounter , leaving Holder 's men clutching at the straws. It was followed by another stinging defeat , this time at the hands of the Indians. Going into the final encounter against UAE , they needed not just a big win but also some help from Pakistan. Both came their way and they just managed to scrape into the knock-out stage . So how 's the preparation for the big match ? The Kiwi camp has stayed focused on the goal ahead and is n't willing to look too far ahead as yet. " This game it has a funny , funny way of biting you if you take your eye off the ball. We know what works for us , " skipper , McCullum said. " We need to go out there and make sure we 're nice and calm in our mindset , and make sure that we know what 's on the line but still be able to execute the skills that have served us so well over a number of games now. In seven hours the game can turn on a knife edge , " he added . If McCullum has led from the front , it 's the bowling department that has well and truly placed New Zealand on the pedestal. The new ball duo of Trent Boult and Tim Southee has given opposing batsmen nightmares - and if you manage to get past them , the towering figure of Dan Vettori confronts them. The orthodox left-arm tweaker has been a revolution in this tournament. He 's not just parsimonious with the ball , but his guile and agility has left many a batsman unstuck. The spinner himself is n't ready to soak into the applause - not with three big games still to come. It 's about knowing that my role is to be a complementary piece to our attacking bowlers , " he said modestly , ahead of the Wellington match . So what 's been the focal point of their campaign ? McCullum 's leadership has come in for a lot of praise and has become the toast of the country. His captaincy is in the mould of his batting , - unbridled aggression - something that Sir Viv Richards greatly admires. " The way he walks on to the field , the way he carries himself , there is an urgency that he brings to this New Zealand team. It is something you look forward to when watching him play , " the legendary West Indian batsman has been quoted as saying . New Zealand : As co-hosts , New Zealand came into the tournament with not just form but also with the backing of the populace. Their confidence has n't been misplaced as Brendon McCullum & Co. have more than just lived up to the hype. It all started with a crushing 98-run win over Sri Lanka in the inaugural game of the tournament , followed by a 3-wicket humbling of Scotland. While the two wins were along expected lines , the massive trouncing of England and an equally gritty one-wicket victory over co-hosts , Australia , made teams stand and take notice. New Zealand were n't just another contender ; they were fast becoming everyone 's favorites to lift the trophy. McCullum 's men had become the first team to seal a quarter-final berth. Afghanistan offered little fight and Bangladesh a bit more - but New Zealand finished their league engagements with an all-win record . Before we go any further , let 's have a look at the respective teams ' road to the quarter-finals . 12 : 10 Local Time , 23 : 10 GMT , 04 : 40 IST : The quarter-final has moved across from Sydney to Melbourne and from Adelaide to the other part of the Tasman Sea. It 's New Zealand 's turn to host the fourth and final quarter-final , the clash between co-hosts and red-hot favourites , New Zealand and a beleaguered West Indies. The 'Cake Tin ' as the Westpac stadium is famously called - plays host to its first ever World Cup knock-out clash. On form , it should be a straightforward victory for the hosts. But the result is n't always decided on the basis of just form and if there 's one team that can spring a surprise , it is this West Indian team . Preview by Jamie Alter This is what it boils down to. The day that New Zealand cricket fans have been waiting for. If you go by the newspapers and radio and television and chatter on the street , it is a day that was theirs for the taking since the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup started in Christchurch on Valentine 's Day with a commanding victory over Sri Lanka , who were finalists in the last two tournaments. Five wins later , New Zealand 's unbeaten run has set them up for Saturday at Westpac Stadium where they face West Indies in the fourth and final quarter-final for a spot in the World Cup 's final four . West Indies , who lost to Ireland in their first game and who scraped into the knockouts when it seemed the world had written them off. West Indies , without Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard and who lost their No 3 two games into the tournament. West Indies , creaking from administrative instability and with a captain hardly a couple years into international cricket. West Indies , so often on the tipping point of falling into an abyss. West Indies , who true cricket fans will always want to do well for the good of the game . It could not be a better match-up for the final quarter-final of the World Cup. A David-versus-Goliath story. A pre-tournament favourite whose status had risen exponentially over past 12 months leading into the tournament against rank outsiders , who at times , it seems , were struggling to put together a squad . Sir Richard Hadlee simplified the formula for success or failure by saying that four years of preparation and planning boils down to seven hours of cricket on the field. " Once you 're into the knockouts , it is totally different. It comes back to seven hours of cricket , " he said. " This is four years of planning and preparation to get to seven hours , and if you 're good enough you get another seven hours. Good enough again , you get to a final. Another seven hours and potentially you can be crowned world champions. Get it wrong in the quarter-finals - drop a catch , top order fails , the bowlers do n't get it right , the fielding is not as good as it has been - and it can all be over in those seven hours. " So far , New Zealand have played good cricket for the most , barring two scares. They beat Sri Lanka by 98 runs ; Scotland by three wickets ; England by eight wickets ; Australia by one wicket ; Afghanistan by six wickets ; and Bangladesh by three wickets. They have been challenged twice , first by Scotland when chasing 143 and then by Australia in pursuit of 152 , then they won by a single wicket. Nerves ? Plenty , but as Brendon McCullum said on the eve of the big match , that was what the team had prepared for . " One of the things which we 've worked really hard on over the last six to 12 months is being able to make sure we still head into pressure games with the same level of preparation and confidence and understanding of what works for us so we can go out there and exhibit our skills and that 's what tomorrow is going to present for us as well , " he told reporters at the Basin Reserve on Friday. " There is added pressure because it 's a knockout game , but it still does n't take away from the fact that the game is a game , and that does n't change just because there is more on the line. For us , I still think we need to go out and play that attacking brand of cricket which we 've played throughout. It does n't guarantee us success , and I 've said that all the way along. " New Zealand have McCullum , Martin Guptill and Kane Williamson for a formidable top order , but Ross Taylor has struggled and Grant Elliott is in need of a sizeable score. Luke Ronchi has hardly batted in the World Cup. The middle order is where West Indies should really target should New Zealand 's top three fail. They have two good pace bowlers in Jason Holder and Jerome Taylor , but the lack of firepower after that is a concern. Darren Sammy has been given five overs in six matches , Andre Russell , with nine wickets is the only other bowler who looks like picking up wickets. Sulieman Benn 's left-arm spin has produced two wickets in two matches and Kemar Roach , once the leader of the attack , has managed one wicket in three games. Marlon Samuels ' whippish brand of spin has also not been a success on generally unresponsive surfaces . Chris Gayle and the scratchy Dwayne Smith ( his best is 31 and his average 15.50 ) will have to cope with New Zealand 's swing pair of Tim Southee and Trent Boult and then the raw pace of Adam Milne , who McCullum suggested would return to the XI , but West Indies ' bigger test could come against Daniel Vettori , the most economical bowler of the tournament and who has repeatedly had opposition batsmen in knots with his left-arm spin. His 13 wickets have included the scalps of Tillakaratne Dilshan , Mahela Jayawardene , Eoin Morgan , Shane Watson and Steven Smith - all pedigree players. West Indies have lost 14 of their 39 wickets to spin in the tournament , with the common theme being hard-hit shots against slow-turning deliveries. Vettori poses a big threat with his changes of pace and nagging accuracy. Even if the top order gets past Southee and Boult , a threat remains . On Thursday , West Indies ' bowling coach Curtley Ambrose was reminded of what Sammy said the day before about New Zealand , unbeaten in the tournament and backed as hosts , being the team under all the pressure. He smiled , nodded his head , and agreed . " What happened in the preliminary round does n't matter now , " said Ambrose. " It 's about who plays better on the day. One dropped catch or one good innings could change the whole game. It depends who wants it more. New Zealand are one of the favourites to beat us and win the World Cup. We are not. So that extra pressure could take a toll if New Zealand are not strong enough mentally. It 's got nothing to do with cricketing skill , but the extra pressure of playing at home. They expect to beat us , but we are n't under any pressure. We 're going to go out on Saturday and enjoy our cricket , play the best we can , and play to win. " Gayle 's participation is a huge point of speculation. He trained with the team at the Basin Reserve on Friday , but as Holder said , the call will only be taken on match morning. With the team banking on Gayle to return to the line-up , the management will have to take a call on who to drop. The likeliest candidate is Smith , whose best is 31 and average 15.50. Johnson Charles scored 55 from 40 balls against the UAE when opening in Gayle 's place , so he should hold on to his spot. If Smith is retained , Charles could drop down a spot to No 3. Should that happen , Jonathan Carter may have to move out , even though he scored his maiden ODI fifty in the previous match . West Indies did not play a spinner against UAE , getting through Samuels for ten overs , but that may change too. The options are Suleiman Benn and Nikita Miller , with Roach the man to face the chop . On February 14 , McCullum 's team gave the home fans plenty more reason to be loved on Valentine 's Day. Exactly six weeks later , West Indies will be out to break many hearts .
