Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 The Proteas , widely-regarded as one of the favourites for a first world title , suffered a sobering wake-up call against India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground last weekend after a far from convincing opening win over Zimbabwe . " We are obviously disappointed , we did n't play good cricket , " said Amla , who has yet to hit top gear after making 11 against Zimbabwe and then 22 in the Indian rout . " The format of this tournament is such that you have to move on , that 's how we look at it. We made a few mistakes but the game is done and dusted and we certainly want to look ahead to the important match on Friday. " Amla said South Africa have learnt their lessons ahead of Friday 's game at the Sydney Cricket Ground where they will face a West Indies team they defeated 4-1 at home in January . " They won their last game , " Amla said of the West Indies who beat Zimbabwe on Tuesday on the back of Chris Gayle 's World Cup record double century . " They are a dangerous team and you can never take them for granted. They are an explosive team , we had them in South Africa not long ago and showed that they can produce games where they fire , they have a lot of match-winners in their team , " said Amla . " We are going to be treating them with the respect that we treat all teams.
