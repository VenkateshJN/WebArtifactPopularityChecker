Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 The 27-year-old Ali hit a six off Majid Haq in the 29th over to score his second career century in his 20th ODI before being dismissed in the 35th over off the same bowler , hitting straight to Freddie Coleman at deep midwicket . After Ali 's dismissal , England , who were thrashed by Australia and New Zealand in their earlier matches , lost Gary Ballance ( 10 ) and Joe Root ( 1 ) in quick succession. From 201 from one , England were suddenly reduced to 203 for four in the space of just 10 balls . That mini collapse put brakes in the slog overs as England could add 78 runs from the final 10 overs and 48 from the final five . Captain Eoin Morgan scored a useful 42-ball 46 and shared 49 runs with Jos Buttler ( 24 of 14 balls ) for the fifth wicket to push England for a final assault . However , England again lost wickets in a heap towards the end with Buttler , Morgan and Chris Woakes ( 1 ) being dismissed in the space of six balls in the 49th and 50th overs. Davey was on a hat-trick in the final over but Stuart Broad denied him the honour . Davey was the most successful Scotland bowler with figures of 4 for 68 in the match which was held four years and one day after the city was rocked by a devastating earthquake which killed 185 people .
