( AP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 ADELAIDE : Michael Clarke fought off back pain to reach his century against the odds and put Australia in a strong position in the first Test against India on Wednesday . The Australian skipper , who retired hurt on 60 on the opening day with lower back trouble , returned to the crease to notch his 28th Test hundred on the rain-disrupted second day . Clarke brought up his ton with a single off his pads , taking off his helmet and kissing its emblem in celebration , to the acclaim of the Adelaide Oval crowd in the wake of the Phillip Hughes tragedy . The captain played a leading role in the days after Hughes 's death , in which he read a tearful tribute at the funeral and was one of the pallbearers . Test team-mate Hughes died after he was struck by a bouncer in a domestic game late last month . Clarke , who needed painkillers to get to the wicket on Wednesday , reached his three figures off 127 balls with 15 boundaries . He continued his great scoring record at Adelaide Oval with five hundreds and two double-centuries , coming into this Test match with a 98.38 ground average . It was the third century of the Australian first innings , with Steve Smith getting his fifth Test ton and David Warner hitting 145 on the first day . After tea , Australia were 473/6 with Smith on 142 and Clarke 109 when rain stopped play . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
