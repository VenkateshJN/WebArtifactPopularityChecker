ECB chairman opens door to Kevin Pietersen return The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Mar 1 , 2015 , 05.54PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 LONDON : Incoming England and Wales Cricket Board ( ECB ) chairman Colin Graves has given Kevin Pietersen a glimmer of hope that he may yet be able to resurrect his England career . Pietersen , 34 , has not played for England since the ECB effectively called time on his international career following the disastrous Ashes tour of 2013-14 . But with England toiling at the ICC World Cup 2015 and Pietersen having spoken of his eagerness to return to the team , Graves has suggested that a return to English county cricket could open the door for a dramatic comeback . " The first thing he has to do if he wants to get back is start playing county cricket , " Graves told BBC Radio 5 on Sunday . " The selectors and the coaches are not going to pick him if he 's not playing. It 's as simple as that. I 'll leave it at that. " Pietersen is currently without a county after leaving Surrey and although Graves is not an ECB selector , he believes a county return would help the outspoken South Africa-born batsman 's cause . Asked if he was in favour of Pietersen returning for England , Graves replied : " At the end of the day it 's down to the selectors and coaches and what they feel is best for English cricket . " They will make the decisions and I will support their decisions.
