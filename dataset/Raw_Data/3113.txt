World Cup 2015 : South Africa 's Philander out of West Indies clash The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Feb 24 , 2015 , 11.04AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 SYDNEY : South Africa seamer Vernon Philander has been ruled out of Friday 's key World Cup clash against the West Indies in Sydney after failing to recover from a hamstring injury . Philander hobbled off the field after sending down just four overs in Sunday 's 130-run loss to India in Melbourne. When he batted , he was dismissed for nought . " Vernon sustained a Grade 1 hamstring strain which was confirmed by the scans done in Sydney on Monday afternoon , " Proteas team manager Mohammed Moosajee said on Tuesday . " The recovery period for a hamstring strain normally takes a week to 10 days which makes him unavailable for the match against the West Indies in Sydney on Friday. " Moosajee added it was too early to tell if Philander , 29 , will be available for the match against Ireland in Canberra on March 3 , and that the all-rounder will be given the best opportunity to recover to full fitness . " The Ireland match , as we speak , is eight days away , " he said. " With the recovery period being a week to 10 days , we have to give him every opportunity to make sure that he can be available . " At the same time we do n't want to be foolish by taking short-cuts , we will go through the usual treatment protocols and the return-to-play protocols . " If he passes all the fitness tests and is symptom free going into the Ireland game he may play but at this stage it is too early to tell. " Philander , who took two for 30 in South Africa 's opening 62-run win over Zimbabwe , has taken 37 wickets in 26 ODIs .
