Greatest CWC Moment - 28 Days to Go Background New Zealand had hosted England for two games in what was its last One-Day International series prior to the 1975 World Cup. Turner made scores of 8 not out and 18 then . However , with rain forcing both games to be abandoned , New Zealand did not have much momentum heading into the big event , where it was in Group A with England , India and East Africa . The Moment Glenn Turner was 28 years old when he led New Zealand to the semi-finals of the inaugural edition of the ICC Cricket World Cup in 1975. New Zealand was up against East Africa in its opening match. Turner won the toss , opted to bat , and led from the front with an unbeaten 171 to take New Zealand to an imposing 309 for 5 in 60 overs .

Turner scored 16 fours and two sixes in his 201-ball innings , and East Africa lost by 181 runs . New Zealand , however , lost its next match by 80 runs to England , and then had to play India in the final group game. India was bowled out for just 230 before the Indian bowlers fought back to reduce New Zealand to 70 for 3. But Turner once again came to the fore , rescuing his team with an unbeaten 114 and taking New Zealand past the post with seven balls left . “ New Zealand owed their victory to a superb century by their captain , Turner , who batted stylishly and productively for three hours. He hit thirteen boundaries and remained unbeaten for 114 as six other partners came and went for modest contributions. Turner 's calmness when wickets were falling regularly at the other end proved too much for India and the New Zealand captain did everything but make the winning hit. ” Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack on the New Zealand-India match What happened next New Zealand faced West Indies , the eventual World Cup winner , in the semifinal. Turner chipped in with a valuable 36 but New Zealand went from 98 for 1 to 158 all out after his dismissal . “ It was a bit like those game shows where someone wins cash and you hold the up the big cardboard cheque.
