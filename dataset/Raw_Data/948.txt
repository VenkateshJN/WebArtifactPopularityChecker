Â© AFP Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza has been suspended for one ODI and fined 40 per cent of his match fee , while his players have been fined 20 per cent of their match fees for maintaining a slow over-rate during the cricket World Cup 2015 quarter-final against India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Thursday . Match referee Roshan Mahanama imposed the suspension on Mashrafe after Bangladesh was ruled to be two overs short of its target at the end of the match when time allowances were taken into consideration . As Mashrafe had also been found guilty of a minor over-rate offence during the World Cup 2015 match against England on March 9 , this offence constituted his second minor over-rate offence for the purposes of the ICC Code of Conduct . Mashrafe pleaded guilty to the offence and accepted the proposed sanction , so there was no need for a formal hearing . As Bangladesh have no more matches left in the cricket World Cup 2015 , Mashrafe will miss the next ODI , which is currently scheduled against Pakistan in April/May .
