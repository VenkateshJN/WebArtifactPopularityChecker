SLC T20 tournament April 6 , 2015 Welegedara spell equals world record ESPNcricinfo staff shares 15 File photo : Welegedara produced figures of 4-2-2-4 © Getty Images Chanaka Welegedara equalled the world record for the most economical four-over T20 spell , as Tamil Union handed out a 45-run defeat to Sinhalese Sports Club at the Colombo Cricket Club Ground . Welegedara , returning figures of 4-2-2-4 , equalled the record set by Chris Morris in a Ram Slam T20 game last year . Tamil Union , led by Welegedara , elected to bat , and posted 142 , Kithuruwan Vithanage top-scoring with a 35-ball 42 that included four sixes. Chamara Kapugedara ( 3 for 14 ) and Binura Fernando ( 2 for 17 ) were the most successful bowlers for SSC . Welegedara struck twice in the fifth over to remove Minod Bhanuka and captain Thilina Kandamby. He then sent back Sachithra Senanayake in the seventh over , before trapping Charith Jayampathi in front in the 11th. At that point , SSC had slumped to 62 for 7 , and were eventually bowled out for 97 in 15.3 overs . © ESPN Sports Media Ltd . on April 8 , 2015 , 7 : 09 GMT @ shanmugan murugavel he got 4 wickets for 2 runs, on April 8 , 2015 , 5 : 06 GMT Chanaka Welagedera is the unsung hero of Sri Lankan fast bowling. Now nearing the end of his career , which has been racked with injuries throughout , he could have been the spear-head SL was so desperately looking for. The injuries were not due to a lack of fitness , as he 's one of the hardest trainers I know ( he plays for and captains my club Tamil Union , where I am involved in cricket adminisrtation ) but other factors inherent in the body. I hope that , with this Season 's performance in the Domestic League , he 'll be a serious contender for a pace slot for the upcoming Pakistan and Indian series in SL . SLMaster on April 7 , 2015 , 14 : 03 GMT Fresh group of bowler under Vaas along with Lakmal , Nuwan Pradeep , Eranga will do good for SL . on April 7 , 2015 , 9 : 53 GMT sad too old for SL at national level.... need to blood them young ! ! where are the talent hunters ? why not look north and east too... . on April 7 , 2015 , 9 : 12 GMT I am Confused ! Morris got 2-2 , Welegadara got 4-4 How its equaled ? Ramansilva on April 7 , 2015 , 5 : 20 GMT I hope he can serve Sri Lanka for couple of more years at the ineternational level . chethanaromesh on April 7 , 2015 , 0 : 47 GMT But he is too late for the international arena. He is already 34. No chance to play a world cup. May be he can play couple of test matches for few years. But chances should be given to the youngsters. India have so many quality players age above 30. But they give chances to youngsters. Eg - Shewagh,Zaheer,Ghambeer,Uvaraj,Harbajan . SLMaster on April 6 , 2015 , 20 : 26 GMT Good to hear. However , too late for international. He got his fare share to perform in international but fell little short . Udendra on April 6 , 2015 , 18 : 40 GMT Amazing spell. Hope he makes it to the national team again . Starvybz on April 6 , 2015 , 17 : 05 GMT Is n't this the guy who ducks first then throws the bat at short balls.
