READ MORE : Why this could be South Africa 's World Cup India started the defence of their title with a convincing 76-run win over Pakistan in Adelaide last Sunday , with Virat Kohli -- the new idol of his country 's adoring fans in Tendulkar 's absence -- making a brilliant 107 . However , Tendulkar said India would need a strong opening partnership and careful running between the wickets to beat South Africa , one of the pre-tournament favourites , in this coming Sunday 's clash at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . " It wo n't be so easy to pick singles , " Tendulkar told Headlines Today TV on Monday . " They ( South Africa ) are much faster , their throwing arm is more powerful and their outfielding ... they cover the area much better than Pakistan. " Tendulkar singled out South Africa 's spearhead Dale Steyn as the man India 's batsmen needed to fear . " Without any doubt he 's their strike bowler. He 's bowled unbelievably well , " he said . " You ca n't pre-decide how to play Steyn , he could also have a bad day , you have to decide in the moment but you have to respect Dale Steyn , you need to be watchful upfront but take your opportunities. " Tendulkar also backed India opener Rohit Sharma to come good at the World Cup , despite managing just 15 runs against Pakistan , along with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni who recently led the side on a miserable three-month tour of Australia . " I would n't put any pressure on Rohit. Next time you 'll get it right , " said Tendulkar . 'The Little Master ' also insisted India could retain the World Cup trophy , saying " definitely we can match up " to the standards of co-hosts Australia and South Africa . " ( But ) To win the World Cup the whole team will have to play consistently play well... It 's not just about a couple of individuals.
