The BCCI 's sub-committee dealing with such matters gave the West Indian 's bowling action the go-ahead at the ICC-accredited centre in Chennai where former India pacer Javagal Srinath oversaw the whole proceedings on Thursday . " I am happy that we will witness Sunil Narine in action in the Pepsi IPL 8 , since he is now cleared by the BCCI committee. We look forward to the opening match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians on the 8th of April in Kolkata , which promises to provide an exciting start to the tournament , " BCCI honorary secretary Anurag Thakur told iplt20.com . KKR had earlier threatened to pull out on the Narine issue. The mystery spinner could n't play the Champions League final last year for the same reason and was sorely missed in KKR 's defeat by Chennai Super Kings . KKR chief executive Venky Mysore expressed his joy on the outcome. " It is a matter of genuine relief. We are very thankful to the BCCI president , secretary and other board officials for bringing the matter reach the appropriate conclusion , " Mysore told ESPNcricinfo . Narine was the second-highest wicket-taker last season with 21 wickets in 16 matches and played a big role in KKR 's second title win . © Cricbuzz
