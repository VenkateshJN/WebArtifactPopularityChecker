World Cup 2015 : Centre bats for fans in apex court The author has posted comments on this article Amit Choudhary , TNN | Feb 18 , 2015 , 09.02AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 NEW DELHI : The Centre on Tuesday batted for the country 's cricket lovers and told the Supreme Court that World Cup matches involving India were of public importance and people could not be deprived of watching the games through cable network . Appearing before a bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and PC Ghose , attorney general Mukul Rohatgi said Prasar Bharati should be allowed to share feed of these matches with cable operators. It said restraining the public broadcaster from sharing feed would deprive 95 million people of watching the matches . " There has been a 'mustcarry ' obligation and the same condition has been prevailing for the last seven years , " Rohatgi said while challenging Delhi High Court 's order restraining the public broadcaster from sharing feed with cable operators. He said only nine matches out of the total 44 could be telecast through cable operators . Senior counsel P Chidambaram and Pratibha Maninder Singh , appearing for ESPN-Star which hold exclusive broadcasting rights of World Cup matches , said it would cause revenue loss to the company which brought the rights after paying more than Rs 3,800 crore.They suggested that matches be telecast on a separate channel with a ticker saying " this content can not be used by cable and private DTH " shown twice an hour during the live match . The AG said it was not technically feasible and told the court that commercial interest should not be allowed to prevail upon public interest. The bench , however , asked Prasar Bharati to respond to ESPN-Star 's proposal and posted the matter for hearing on February 19. India 's next match is on February 22 .
