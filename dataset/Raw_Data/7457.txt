shares 12 Jeremy Snape has worked with England and South Africa before , as well as T20 franchises © Getty Images Sri Lanka have enlisted the assistance of sports psychologist Jeremy Snape , for a second stint with the team , during the upcoming World Cup. Snape , a former England offspinner , had already worked with Sri Lanka during the home series against England last November and December. SLC had hired him for that first stint with a view to employing him again during the World Cup . " Jeremy Snape will be with the Sri Lankan team for 14 days , from February 24 to March 9 , " an official release said. " Jeremy will be able to enhance individual performance of the national team. This move is bound to add value to the system at this crucial stage and will support to derive the maximum output of players to face any challenges in the upcoming World Cup 2015 in particular. " Sri Lanka 's record at recent World Cups had been a catalyst for the decision to sign a sports psychologist , with a pattern of failure in high-pressure matches having developed over the past seven years. Sri Lanka lost four major finals between 2007 and 2012 , and though the team has since won the 2014 Word T20 , there had been a substantial push to employ a sports psychologist to buttress the World Cup effort . An offspinning-allrounder in his playing career , Snape played 10 ODIs and a T20I for England , in addition to 121 first-class matches. He has a masters degree in sports psychology , and has worked with England , South Africa , as well as teams in the IPL and Big Bash League . He is the second member of support staff to join the team for part of the tournament. Coach Rumesh Ratnayake was also recently sent to New Zealand , to work as a consulting coach until February 20 .
