( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 WELLINGTON : Sri Lanka 's Kumar Sangakkara added another milestone to his already storied career when he broke the world record for the most dismissals by a wicketkeeper in one-day internationals against New Zealand in Wellington on Thursday . The 37-year-old Sangakkara , who is expected to retire from international cricket after the World Cup , passed Adam Gilchrist as the most successful wicketkeeper with the dismissal of Corey Anderson in the seventh and final one-dayer . The former Sri Lanka captain took his career tally to 473 dismissals when he caught New Zealand all-rounder Anderson off the bowling of Shaminda Eranga . Sangakkara , who has also scored his 21st one-day century in Sri Lanka 's 287-6 in their 50 overs , has taken 377 catches and effected 96 stumpings in the 50-over format as a wicket-keeper . He also has 198 dismissals in Test cricket , though 47 catches have been achieved since he gave up being a wicketkeeper in the longest form of the game in 2008 . Australia 's former wicketkeeper Gilchrist achieved 472 dismissals in 287 one-day matches . Sangakkara equalled Gilchrist 's mark in the sixth match in Dunedin on Sunday when he caught opening batsman Martin Guptill for 28 off Thisara Perera in the 14th over . The World Cup , which is co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia , runs from Feb.14-March 29 . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
