Four years after they won the World Cup at home , they bowed out in the semi-finals , beaten by Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday . India came into the World Cup with low expectations after struggling during their build-up but lifted themselves up when it mattered. ( India Crumbled Under Pressure : Gavaskar ) They went through their six pool matches and easily won their quarter-final against Bangladesh but ran into a red-hot Australian side . India 's players were disappointed to lose but gracious in defeat , acknowledging that the Australians had played better. For India 's captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni , it was a moment tinged with sadness . Four years ago , Dhoni led India to win the World Cup on home soil , setting off one of the biggest celebrations seen in the world 's largest democracy. ( Dhoni Goes Down Fighting ) India knocked out the Australians in the quarter-finals , ending their run of three successive World Cup titles between 1999 and 2007 , and went on to win the final. ( Dhoni Defends Virat Kohli ) " It 's something that does n't really belong to anyone. We definitely took it from someone , so somebody took it from us. It 's as simple as that , " Dhoni said . " The best team takes it for four years and then everybody gets their own plans ready , depending on the conditions , and they challenge the one that has the Cup . " It does n't stay with one for long , but that 's how it has been. If we would have played better cricket on this particular day , maybe we would have gone into the final . But that 's how it is. In any international sport you have to be at your best. If not , the Cup gets shared. " For Dhoni and his players , the consolation for losing was they get to go home a few days earlier. The Indian team have been in Australia for four months , playing a four-match test series and a warm-up tournament before the World Cup , and are fatigued . They came away empty handed , losing the tests and the One Day International tournament they entered , but with renewed hope for the future and a ringing endorsement from Sachin Tendulkar . " Well played in the ICC World Cup Team India , " the Indian batting great tweeted. " A tough game today and a loss is always difficult to handle. But you have played some terrific cricket throughout and all the fans have enjoyed watching you. Congratulations to Australia for a convincing win. " The good news for India is that they will not have to wait long for their next chance to be the world champions. Next year , the Twenty20 World Cup will be held in India and Dhoni wants to play on , scoffing at suggestions he might retire .
