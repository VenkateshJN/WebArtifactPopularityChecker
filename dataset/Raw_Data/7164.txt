0 ( 1w ) 2.3 to Gautam , and Nehra has won the early contest. Gautam never looked comfortable against him , trying to manufacture shots. Yet again he tries a shot that is not on. Looks to go over mid-on , but this length ball is too close to him , and he has sent this straight down mid-on 's throat. Nehra blows him a kiss as he walks off. Love is in the air 15/1 2.6 to Agarwal , and Nehra has taken out the openers in one over. Agarwal tries one shot too many. Nehra has run his fingers on this. Slightly off-pace with another forceful shot , and he is early into it. The outside edge is taken by Dhoni 20/2 4.6 to Iyer , this is not the smartest bit of batting. He has fallen to an old little trap from Dhoni. More experienced/better batsmen do better. After that four first ball , Dhoni has guessed off side is Iyer 's game , and has placed a deep point and opened the third man region. The next three balls : a slog into the leg side , an attempt to open the face , and another slog. This slog goes a mile in the air and settles with du Plessis at extra cover. You have got to make them work harder for your wickets 39/3
