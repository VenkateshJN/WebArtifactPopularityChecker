Last updated on Sunday , 26 October , 2014 20 : 35 IST Total Shares Steve Smith reacts as he walks off after being dismissed for 55 on the final day . Â© AP Dubai : Zulfiqar Babar took a maiden five-wicket haul and fellow leg-spinner Yasir Shah took four as Pakistan humiliated Australia by 221 runs in the first Test in Dubai on Sunday. ( Scorecard | Pics ) Babar finished with 5-74 in only his third Test , while debutant Shah took 4-50 to dismiss a resolute Australia for 216 in their second innings and give Pakistan a 1-0 lead in the two-Test series . Pakistan , who set Australia a 438-run target , were left frustrated as Mitchell Johnson ( 61 ) and Steven Smith ( 55 ) fought hard before they succumbed in a tantalising finish with just 21.5 overs left in the day . Pakistan will now hope they either win or avoid defeat in the second Test in Abu Dhabi , starting October 30 , to clinch their first series win over Australia since 1994 . This was Australia 's ninth defeat in Asia in the last 14 Tests , having lost eight to India since 2008. Their only win came in Sri Lanka in 2011 with four draws as they fell to south Asia 's specialist spinners . Babar dismissed number ten Peter Siddle , caught bat-pad in the 92nd over , to seal the victory as Pakistani fielders removed the stumps even before the Australian review was turned down . The defeat looked inevitable with Australia reeling at 117-7 at lunch but Smith and Johnson defied the spinners during their 65-run stand for the eighth wicket . Babar threatened to dismiss Smith twice but Sarfarza missed a stumping with the batsman on 37 and Misbah-ul Haq failed to pick a difficult chance at 44 . Frustrated Babar also saw Ahmed Shehzad drop Johnson at deep square leg on 23 and two runs later by Yasir Shah as both the batsmen frustrated the Pakistani attack . Smith hit Shah for his third four to reach his seventh half-century but fell five runs later , caught at short-leg . Smith resisted for 175 balls . It was Babar who struck twice before lunch to bring Pakistan closer to victory . Australia had resumed on 59-4 but Chris Rogers ( 43 ) and Smith added 32 in the first hour before paceman Imran Khan made the breakthrough , bowling Rogers who played over the delivery . Babar then came into his own , removing Mitchell Marsh ( three ) with a turning delivery. The edge was well taken at short cover by Azhar Ali . Four overs later , Babar spun one across Brad Haddin 's forward push to hit the stumps and dismiss the wicketkeeper for a duck as Australia lost their seventh wicket for 105 . Johnson smashed Babar for his fifth boundary to reach ninth half-century off 104 balls. In all he hit six fours and one six during his 163-minute fight . Babar 's previous best figures were 3-89 against South Africa in his debut Test in Abu Dhabi last year . Australia 's top order , including captain Michael Clarke , had flopped on the fourth evening , with Babar and leg-spinner Yasir Shah causing the damage . Pakistan dominated the game throughout , piling up 454 and 286-2 declared while Australia scored 303 in their first innings . This becomes Pakistan 's second straight win over Australia after beating them at Leeds in the teams ' last Test in 2010 , but their biggest in terms of the winning margin . Pakistan 's previous best win over Australia in terms of runs was their 74-run win in Sydney in 1995 .
