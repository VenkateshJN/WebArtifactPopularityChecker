Anderson-Jadeja hearing set for Tuesday The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Jul 17 , 2014 , 09.26PM IST Both players were charged by the respective opposing teams following an altercation during the lunch break on the second day of last week 's drawn first Test. ( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 LONDON : England 's James Anderson and India 's Ravindra Jadeja will face a preliminary hearing regarding their International Cricket Council disciplinary charges on Tuesday , the global governing body has announced . Both players were charged by the respective opposing teams following an altercation during the lunch break on the second day of last week 's drawn first Test at Trent Bridge . The ICC announced Thursday that the first stage of the disciplinary process would involve a preliminary hearing via a teleconference conducted by Australian judicial commissioner Gordon Lewis on Tuesday -- the day after the ongoing second Test at Lord 's is due to end . The task at hand for Lewis is to , the ICC said , " address preliminary issues " before setting a date for a full hearing . It is unlikely , although possible , that a decisive outcome will be reached on Tuesday . What could well happen is an amendment to the level of charge facing either Anderson or Jadeja . England were shocked that Anderson was charged by India at all and particularly taken aback that he was deemed by the tourists to have committed a Level Three offence -- the second most serious under the ICC code -- for allegedly " abusing and pushing Jadeja " . That led England to retaliate with a Level Two charge against Jadeja on Wednesday . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
