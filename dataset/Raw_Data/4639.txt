Ravindra Jadeja fields the ball during a World Cup match in Auckland. ( AP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 MELBOURNE : An enthusiast recently said of Ravindra Jadeja : " He 's like Ram Gopal Verma. Once he used to make some of the best movies you ever saw. And now , he 's making Aag and Phoonk. " Full coverage : ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 This was certainly a bit harsh , considering the left-hander had been lying low with injury before coming to the World Cup and has been taking a while getting into his own. After all , he played a key role in India 's triumph at the 2013 Champions Trophy . But things can reverse quickly in Indian cricket. Jadeja began to allow us to expect from him and that 's where analogies are coming up , reminding how he 's been delivering the wrong lines recently . This clamour will keep going , and growing. The World Cup is on and it 's only expected that experts and fans have their take on what is good and bad with Team India . Jadeja , for his part , has been impressive as a fielder.Where batting goes , the responsibility has n't fallen on his blade to provide the finishing touches yet and time will tell what he does when such an occasion does arise . It 's his bowling which has left everyone wondering whether he fits the bill of a frontline bowler well enough . He has been a bit flat and unimaginative , or so it 's beginning to seem. Jadeja 's been going through a bad patch. As much as Dhoni might want Rohit Sharma to crack another double ton in one of the knockouts going ahead , he 'd want Jadeja to pick one of those five-fors that he kept showing the potential for until a year ago . Did n't he and the selectors opt for Jadeja despite the long break from injury knowing he was capable ?
