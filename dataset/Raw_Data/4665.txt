Match in Pics | Points Table " We played very well for long periods of that game today. But is just show how ruthless you have to be the way India batted there . " You have to kick on and score hundreds. We had a couple of 60s and 70s there. But we 've chased down 300 and we 've set 330 when we batted first. " Porterfield said Ireland had lost a couple of quick wickets and then managed to lose a wicket every time they picked up momentum . " We could probably have put them under a bit of pressure but we did n't want to go too hard too soon especially after losing those couple of wickets .

Porterfield said the team would " hone up " on Adelaide in the next couple of days . " We will have everything behind the scenes ready , " he said .
