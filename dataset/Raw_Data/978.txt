Last updated on Friday , 27 March , 2015 09 : 31 IST Total Shares MS Dhoni defends his star batsman 's loss of form Â© Getty Images Sydney : Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni today defended an under-fire Virat Kohli for his indiscreet shot selection in the lost semi-final clash against Australia in the ICC Cricket World Cup , here today. ( Match Report ) Chasing an imposing 329 for a win , India were bundled out for 233 in 46.5 overs with Dhoni top-scoring with a run-a-ball 65 as the batting was guilty of buckling under pressure , including Kohli ( 1 ) . Asked if Kohli 's shot selection was reflective of the pressure on him , Dhoni batted strongly for his deputy. ( Anushka Should Not be Blamed for Kohli 's Poor Form : Ganguly ) " Pehli baat yeh hai ki til ka taad nahin banate hain ( Let 's not make a mountain out of a mole hill ) . Let 's accept the fact that he played a shot that did n't pay off. It happens and it happens to a lot of batsmen , " Dhoni said in the post-match conference. ( India Crumbled Under Pressure : Gavaskar ) " Once the opposition puts over 300 runs on the board and once they have quality bowlers , at some point of time you have to take that risk. If it pays off , if it clicks , all of a sudden everything changes. He played a shot , it did n't pay off and that 's it. I would say it happens in cricket , " he added . The skipper did admit that there were a few niggles as far as bowlers were concerned but at the same time said that it was n't anything alarming . " About fitness , a few of them ( bowlers ) had a few niggles , but the whole unit was 100 per cent fit. Fast bowlers had a bit of niggle , but nothing that really stops them from playing , so there were no fitness issues as such. " Asked as to when did he think that the chase was becoming difficult and probably they were n't going to win it , the wicketkeeper-batsman answered , " I think after the fall of third wicket , I somehow sensed that it would be difficult from here on. " With the fast bowlers having done well throughout , Dhoni was n't harsh on them for their flop show on the day , stating that they could have done " slightly better " . " When we lost the toss , I was a bit worried as I thought maybe the spinners would n't get as much purchase. But I feel ( Ravindra ) Jadeja and ( Ravichandran ) Ashwin , both bowled well. There was possibility of reverse swing going , so I felt our fast bowlers could have slightly better as there would n't be much of a reverse swing. But once we came back into the game and restricted them to 328 , I felt it was a good score . " Yes , there was pressure , but at the same time it needed some good batting and good partnership , so it was a gettable score , but it needed some really hard work to get the runs on the board , " the skipper said .
