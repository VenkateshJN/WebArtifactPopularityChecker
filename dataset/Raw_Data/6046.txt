6th October 1930 Birth of Richie Benaud Birth of one of the sharpest brains behind the mike - Sir Richie Benaud. As a cricketer , he was quite superb. A leg-break googly bowler , Benaud finished an impressive career with 248 wickets from 63 Tests. A versatile all-rounder during his playing days , Benaud brought the best out of him in front of the mike. Joining Kerry Packer in revolutionizing TV commentary , Benaud is the face of cricket in Australia - his ability to read the game and his authority over the language has made him one of the biggest voices of the game . This day ( in 1946 ) also marks the birth anniversary of Tony Greig . Â© Cricbuzz
