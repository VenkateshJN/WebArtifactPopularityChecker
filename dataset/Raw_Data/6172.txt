3 6.00 0.6 to Kallis , gem of a delivery , superb start on the comeback , that 's pitched full on the off and just hint of inward shape as Kallis gets forward to drive it towards the off side , misses it completely and knocks the stumps. 5/1 2.3 to Hussey , Pattinson knocks another one , both the openers are gone now , that 's slightly short and moving across from the leftie , he stays on the crease and tries to dab it down , inside edge onto the flap of the pad which ricochet back onto the stumps. 13/2 4.6 to McDonald , that 's three for Pattinson in three consecutive overs , and all are bowled. This one touch short and angling in from outside off as McDonald stays on the crease and tries to work it on the leg side which kisses his pad and it knocks the off stump out of the ground. 31/3
