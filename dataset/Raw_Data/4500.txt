Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 Their attempt to overhaul the 267 all out that Bangladesh posted never recovered from the loss of Javed Ahmadi , Afsar Zazai and Asghar Stanikzai in 13 balls that left them facing humiliation at 3-3 after the opening three overs . Bangladesh skipper Mashrafe Mortaza ( 3-20 ) took two of the wickets to help spur his side to a measure of revenge for the defeat in the only previous meeting between the countries at the Asia Cup last year . Shakib Al Hasan , who tops the all-rounder world rankings , was missing from that match but played a key role in Wednesday 's victory after Afghanistan had shackled the Bangladeshi batsmen and reduced them to 119 to four in the 30th over . Teaming up with Mushfiqur Rahim ( 71 ) to plunder 114 runs off 93 balls for the fifth wicket , Shakib ( 63 ) also became the first Bangladeshi to score 4,000 one-day runs . Despite spinner Samiullah Shenwari being forced out of the attack by the umpire for following through onto the danger area , four Afghan bowlers took two wickets apiece and they will have been encouraged by bowling Bangladesh out . That encouragement did not last much beyond the innings break and although Nawroz Mangal ( 27 ) and Samiullah Shenwari ( 42 ) averted complete humiliation with a fourth wicket partnership of 62 , the run chase never looked on . Shakib 's left-arm spin accounted for Najibullah Zadran ( 17 ) , who looked unfortunate not escape the lbw decision on appeal as the ball appeared to strike him on the pad outside the line of the off-stump . After Nabi lashed out at a Mortaza delivery on the following ball and was caught at mid-off for 44 , the end was not long coming and wicketkeeper Mushfiqur performed the coup de grace by running out Aftab Alam to end the innings with 162 runs on the board .
