Loading comments IPSY on December 30 , 2014 , 12 : 09 GMT I was not surprised that they did not declare. Australia has already shown that they are afraid of the Kohli-factor. The Aussies would have declared against any Indian batting line up before this one. Oh , they 're so afraid of Kohli ! At last india has a DEMON batsman - they 've been trying to bulldoze the world to claim one for years . on December 30 , 2014 , 7 : 48 GMT I 'm an Indian who was fortunate to see the entire period of Australian dominance from 1995 to 2008. They had Gilly walking out at 7 ! Warne and McGrath believed they could get any team for 200-250 odd in the last day. From Sri Lanka ( 1994 ) , to Pakistan ( 1999 ) , to India ( Sydney,2008 ) have all suffered the fate. But they do n't have that quality now. They 're honest enough to admit that Kohli and Rahane 's partnership made them unsure about a good target to set. India did the same thing against England ( 2007 ) under Dravid. If you 're chock full of world-beaters , and a misbehaving fifth day pitch , it 's all fair to play a gamble. But had Australia lost the match in trying to be over-adventurous , India would 've found a way back into the series. They did the practical thing. If anything , India did n't want those 3 wkts quickly enough , did n't put close-in fielders to make things happen despite only one recognized batsman. Smith is n't Sobers , and Australia just regained the Border-Gavaskar trophy . sunny346 on December 30 , 2014 , 5 : 52 GMT After looking at the first test 4th innings India batting ,Aus are on back foot for declearing even after 350 runs .But they are right they are leading inseries witn 2-0 they dont want to take risk india need to fight better tomwin final test ...good luck to both teams sarath141 on December 30 , 2014 , 4 : 58 GMT Certainly Australia were not ready to lose given the batting performances of India in recent innings. But is n't the ball in Australia 's court to take a call at right time ? And this is not certainly the time to declare. They have lost the credit of being risk takers . Popular Videos
