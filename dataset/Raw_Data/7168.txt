2 ( 1w ) 10.4 to Binny , it 's that one again - the googly ! Pitched on length outside off and turning in sharply , Binny hardly moves his feet and was trapped right in front of middle and leg , that was plumb 78/4 15.1 to Rahane , it 's a googly , it 's a wicket ! Jinxy charged down , the length ball turned in sharply from outside off as he looked to slog and missed it completely. Ball clips the leg stump 130/5 18.1 to Hooda , Hooda 's holed out , Tahir gets him with a long hop ! It was short and flat , Hooda smashed it to the leg side and found Mathews at long on. The big wicket has come for Delhi 166/6 18.5 to Faulkner , one more for the googly , one more for Tahir. He 's running all the way to Antarctica while celebrating ! Faulkner did n't pick that one as it pitched on length , came in and struck the leg stump as Faulkner swept 173/7
