Â© AFP Chittagong : Young leg-spinner Jubair Hossain grabbed a five-wicket haul in only his third Test to hand Bangladesh the advantage in the third and final Test against Zimbabwe in Chittagong on Friday . The 19-year-old finished with 5-96 as Bangladesh , hoping to sweep the series 3-0 , dismissed Zimbabwe for 374 runs on the third day to gain a 129-run lead .
