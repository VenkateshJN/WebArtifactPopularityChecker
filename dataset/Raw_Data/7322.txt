New Zealand enjoyed unprecedented success under McCullum in 2014 , winning five Tests from nine matches , a national record. It included series victories against India and West Indies , as well as a drawn series against Pakistan in UAE. In ODIs , the team crushed India 4-0 in January 2014 , and secured a hard-fought 3-2 win against Pakistan under spin-heavy conditions in UAE in December . Individually , McCullum scored 1164 Test runs - the most by a New Zealand batsman in a calendar year - at 72.75 and finished as the fourth-highest run scorer in 2014 , despite playing the fewest innings among the top 10 batsmen in the list . McCullum 's stellar year began at Eden Park , where his 224 set New Zealand up for a 40-run win against India. In the second Test at the Basin Reserve , New Zealand were struggling at 94 for 5 in the second innings , still trailing by 152 runs , when McCullum scripted a stunning turnaround. He put up a 352-run partnership with BJ Watling , and eventually became the first New Zealand player to score a triple-hundred , helping his team to a draw and a series win . McCullum had a quiet tour of West Indies , scoring just 87 runs from three Tests , but New Zealand clinched the series 2-1 , their first series win away from home against a top-eight nation in 12 years . In UAE , New Zealand surrendered the first Test against Pakistan by 248 runs , but in the third Test in Sharjah , McCullum blasted a 188-ball 202 , ensuring the visitors leveled the series with an innings and 80-run win. He capped off a fine year by scoring 195 against Sri Lanka in Christchurch , where he also knocked off the record for the fastest hundred by a New Zealand player in Tests , off 74 balls. The innings also ensured that McCullum become the first ever New Zealand batsman to amass 1000 Test runs in a calendar year . © ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
