November 14 down the years An Aussie destroyer shares 1971 In its rich history , Test cricket has never seen a player quite like Adam Gilchrist , who was born today. When Ian Healy retired it looked as if a chink might be appearing in Australia 's armour , but instead they brought in a wicketkeeper who averaged over 40 , and scored those runs at an indecent rate. With his ability to nail a good position created by the top order , Gilchrist was central to Steve Waugh 's great Test-cricket revolution of winning the toss and bowling first. His innings include a brutal 152 against England at Edgbaston in 2001 , as well as the astonishing 122 that set up victory over India in Mumbai , when he smashed his century off 84 balls. In the heavyweight clash in South Africa in 2001-02 , Gilchrist walloped 204 not out off only 213 balls in Johannesburg. He also has the second fastest Test century ( by balls ) after Viv Richards and Misbah-ul-Haq and is the only player to hit 100 Test sixes . He quit Test cricket in 2007-08 but his reflexes did n't desert him during the IPL , where he played for the Deccan Chargers and led to them to the title in 2009 . 1904 Birth of a man best remembered for his part in the Bodyline controversy. Harold Larwood was Douglas Jardine 's main man when he unleashed his leg theory on Australia in 1932-33. In five Tests Larwood took 33 wickets at 19.51 , and made even Don Bradman seem human. After that Larwood was never picked for England again , partly because of his refusal to apologise for tactics others had devised. But his part in the controversy should not obscure Larwood 's brilliance. Although he was n't a tall man , he was hostile and fiercely quick , with an action so vigorous that , legend has it , his knuckles would scrape the surface in his follow-through. He was a lusty hitter , too , and in his last Test , in Sydney , he creamed 98 as nightwatchman. Larwood , who was loudly barracked in Australia when he played , ironically later emigrated there , and died in Sydney in 1995 . 1981 A Dennis Lillee -inspired rout at the WACA in Perth , as Pakistan were dismissed for just 62 , their lowest-ever Test score until they twice plumbed new depths in the same match against Australia in Sharjah in 2002-03. Their innings lasted only 21.2 overs , and it could have been a lot worse - they were 26 for 8 before Sarfraz Nawaz , the only man to reach double figures , flashed a chancy 26. Lillee took 5 for 18 and Terry Alderman 4 for 36 , and Australia eventually won by 286 runs on the final day. But there was controversy on the fourth afternoon , when a vexed Lillee deliberately impeded Javed Miandad and aimed a kick at him , sparking an infamous spat . Miandad threatened to crown Lillee with his bat , before umpire Tony Crafter ended their contretemps. Lillee was suspended from two one-day internationals as a result . 1983 Another Australia-Pakistan encounter at the WACA , and another routine Aussie victory , by an innings and nine runs. Carl Rackemann grabbed match figures of 11 for 118. The result was never in doubt once Wayne Phillips ( 159 on debut ) and Graham Yallop ( 141 ) put on 259 for the second wicket . 1843 Birth of the man to take the first-ever Test wicket. If subtracting bowling average from batting average gives a true measure of the quality of an allrounder , then Yorkshireman Allen Hill ( batting : 50.50 , bowling 18.57 ) was right up there with the very best. But that record came from only two Tests , and in reality Hill was not much of a batsman - his first-class average was 8.94. He was , however , a very good seamer , who bowled Nat Thomson for 1 on the first morning of the first Test in Melbourne in 1876-77. And he took the first catch too. Hill died in Lancashire in 1910 . 1991 A historic day in New Delhi , where South Africa grabbed their first victory since their return to the international stage. They overhauled India 's 287 for 4 to win the third one-dayer in fine style , by eight wickets with 20 balls to spare. The old heads Kepler Wessels ( 90 ) and Peter Kirsten ( 86 * ) did most of the work , and Adrian Kuiper applied the gloss with a punishing unbeaten 63 off 41 balls. It was their captain Clive Rice 's first taste of victory for his country - and his last , because he was then controversially dropped ahead of the 1992 World Cup . 1976 Birth of Hemang Badani , who came into the team in the throes of change post match-fixing , and instantly seemed prepared for the void left down the order by the absence of Ajay Jadeja. Upright , and given to scoring in the V , Badani proved adept at remaining not out , and his high point was a wonderfully paced hundred against Australia in Pune in 2001-02 . Other birthdays
