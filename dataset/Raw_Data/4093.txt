Pakistan 's Mohammad Aamer suffers comeback washout The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Mar 11 , 2015 , 05.38PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 RAWALPINDI ( Pakistan ) : Pakistani fast bowler Mohammad Aamer on Wednesday shrugged off the disappointment of his comeback match being washed out following a five-year ban for spot-fixing . The 22-year-old was due to make his return to competitive domestic cricket this week but a waterlogged pitch -- the after-effects of torrential downpours last week -- meant all three days of his game for Omar Associates were abandoned . Aamer , cleared to return early from his ban for bowling no-balls to order in the Lord 's Test against England in 2010 , said it was " God 's will " the match was rained off . " We have three to four more matches to play God willing and we are focusing on them , " he told reporters . " The next match is quite tough and the opposition in that match is very strong. " Aamer , banned from all cricket along with fellow bowler Mohammed Asif and captain Salman Butt over the spot-fixing scandal , was originally due to return in September . But the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) allowed him to return to domestic matches early in recognition of his contrition over one of the most notorious incidents in the history of the game . His new team , Omar Associates , play grade two cricket , one level below first class , but Aamer -- who has taken 51 wickets in 14 Tests -- said he was concentrating on his own game to try to impress the national selectors . " My ICC ban ( from international matches ) will be over on September 2 , then it depends upon the board -- how they assess my fitness and performance , " he said . " I think I will prove myself in grade two and Super T20 and then it depends upon the selectors. " Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
