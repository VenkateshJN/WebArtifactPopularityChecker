( PTI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 BANGALORE : It took a while to get there and it took some doing by skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja as Chennai Super Kings just about managed to take their score into the realm of respectability in their Oppo Champions League Twenty20 clash against Perth Scorchers at M Chinnaswamy stadium on Saturday . On a night when the Chennai side appeared strangely determined to underwhelm the 20,000 spectators - most of them waving CSK flags - Dhoni 's 16-ball 35 , a cameo masterpiece that included four sixes , took the men in yellow to 155/6 in 20 overs . In the process , Dhoni went past 4,000 career runs in T20s , but whether he should have looked to add to his impressive tally of 4,012 remained a talking point as he came in to bat as low as No. 7 . Perth Scorchers could n't really get a partnership going and were all out of for 142-7 . Lions ride on Akmal 's blitz Pakistan 's wicketkeeper-batsman Umar Akmal produced a mature batting display in a testing situation to help Lahore Lions seal a 16-run win in their Champions League Twenty20 Group A clash against South Africa 's Nashua Dolphins at the M Chinnaswamy stadium here on Saturday . Akmal 's unbeaten 73 ( 45b , 5x4 , 5x6 ) helped Lions recover from 34/4 in the eighth over to an eventual match-winning total of 164/5 in 20 overs. In reply , Morne van Wyk 's winless Dolphins managed 148/9 , despite a late fightback from all-rounder Robert Frylinck ( 63 n.o ; 27b , 4x4 , 6x6 ) . Brief scores : Chennai Super Kings 155-6 ( Jadeja 44 , Dhoni 35 ) beat Perth Scorchers 142-7 ( Coulter-Nile 30 ; Ashwin 3-20 ) by 13 runs ; Lahore Lions 164 for 5 ( U Akmal 73 * , Nasim 43 , Frylinck 3-22 ) beat Dolphins 148 for 9 ( Frylinck 63 * , Hafeez 2-18 ) by 16 runs Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
