Loading comments wapuser on March 29 , 2015 , 7 : 30 GMT Because it 's 7 vs 1 and as a result I smell total burnout by NL. Despite having under 200 on scoreboard for a BIG WIN , I ca n't ignore history of first timers in FINALS. At least NL to play SPARTANS from here. Well done Australia & Good luck New Zealand . on March 29 , 2015 , 1 : 21 GMT If this world cup was played in sub continent i doubt this two teams will be there. this world cup was played without any spin challenge . Home advantage for both teams. no one talks bout this . on March 28 , 2015 , 1 : 31 GMT Good analysis , but there was no discussion of the spinners ; will there be a 'Vettori factor ' to throw into the mix ? ! JJJake on March 28 , 2015 , 0 : 39 GMT I hope Australia have to chase a big score and we end up the a game like the Semi between NZ and SA. That was one of the best games I 've seen. Even as an Australian I was nervous for both teams. The other semi was a bit boring because you always knew Australia was going to win . Popular Videos
