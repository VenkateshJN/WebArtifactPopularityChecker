Sunrisers Hyderabad wary of mighty Kings XI Punjab JAC Gladson JAC Gladson,TNN | May 14 , 2014 , 11.53 AM IST Sunrisers need to address the problem areas that seem to bog them down in the middle overs. ( TOI Photo ) RELATED HYDERABAD : It was a fine opportunity for Sunrisers Hyderabad to enhance their tally and begin the home leg on a positive note , but Lendl Simmons and Ambati Rayudu had other plans and ran away with the match for Mumbai Indians . The hosts will now have to quickly put that seven-wicket defeat behind them ahead of their day-night game at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Wednesday against Kings XI Punjab , who started IPL 7 in a rousing manner and continued the good work till Knight Riders Kolkata halted their run in Cuttack . Now stuck on eight points from nine games , the Sunrisers need to address the problem areas that seem to bog them down in the middle overs if they intend to make a match of it against Punjab , one of the two top teams in this edition along with Chennai Super Kings . Barring the odd occasion , it 's been a case of 'you post 'em , we 'll get 'em ' with Kings XI Punjab , who had few problems in chasing down Chennai Super Kings ' 205 in their opener , and in racking up five of the six top totals in this year 's competition. That includes the high of 231/4 against CSK in Cuttack . The Aussie influence on Kings XI has been pronounced since the days of Adam Gilchrist , not to forget present Hyderabad coach Tom Moody , who will be up against a team he once coached . The toast of the tournament is Maxwell , the 25-year-old Victorian topping the tournament batting charts with 474 runs from nine innings . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Sunrisers Hyderabad,Shikhar Dhawan,Kings XI Punjab,IPL,Glenn Maxwell Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
