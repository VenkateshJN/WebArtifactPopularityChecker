World Cup 2015 : West Indies February 26 , 2015 West Indies mull possibility of replacing Darren Bravo 55 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Comment shares 55 A team spokesperson revealed that Darren Bravo is taking longer than expected to recover from his hamstring injury © Getty Images Five days after sustaining a low-grade tear to his left hamstring , Darren Bravo is still unable to run , which has forced West Indies ' management to " begin discussions " over the possibility of calling for a replacement player. A team spokesperson confirmed to ESPNcricinfo that Bravo is " taking longer than expected to recover " and there is a chance West Indies will need cover . Bravo will sit out West Indies ' next match against South Africa , after also missing Tuesday 's match against Zimbabwe , and he may not be able to make a comeback against India as planned. West Indies have seven days between the games in Sydney and Perth and then another nine days before their final group match against UAE in Napier. It is expected that if Bravo has not recovered in time for the India match , a replacement will be called up . After missing the South Africa tour because of personal issues , Bravo returned for the World Cup with mixed results. He scored two ducks in four innings , including one in a warm-up game , and was on 49 when he retired hurt in the match against Pakistan . Jonathan Carter took his place in the starting XI against Zimbabwe but was not required to bat ; he may get the opportunity to do so against South Africa. West Indies do not have another extra batsman in the side and will have to look at the rest of their talent pool. Leon Johnson , who was part of the ODI series in South Africa albeit without much success , would be one option. Narsingh Deonarine , who also played that series and had a decent score of 43 in one of the matches , may also come into contention .
