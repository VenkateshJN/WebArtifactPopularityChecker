McCullum : " Little bit untidy. Probably in all three facets of the game for us. Credit to Bangladesh , credit to Mahmudullah , I thought his innings , especially when he came into bat , they were under a little bit of pressure and the boys were swinging it. And for him to be able to absorb that and then obviously to go on and post another significant score in a World Cup game is a credit to him and to the Bangladesh boys for putting us under a lot of pressure. But , we need to be better than that. They ( Guptill and Taylor ) have been hitting the ball ok. It 's just probably a little shortage of opportunities as well. Gups is really starting to come into his own. I thought he made a nice score in the last game and obviously today the tempo that he played with from the word go is outstanding. We know he is a quality player , statistics back that up as well and not just what he does with the bat , but in the field again today he was outstanding and few of the other guys need to take a leaf out of that. Obviously it is good for Rosco ( Taylor ) , he is probably a little bit disappointed not to get the strike rate he wanted. But , that partnership was pretty key to allow us to be able to advance the game little bit later on. Exactly he ( Vettori ) and Tim is a leader within the group and I thought his options were excellent , Dan Vettori 's options were really good as well. Thought Corey Anderson up until the ball he got out , he was playing beautifully as well. " " There were a couple of messy things from us tonight , bat , ball and in the field we can improve. Sometimes you are not always going to be on , but I thought our awareness in the field today and our attention at times needs to improve. That is something we pride ourselves on , if we are serious about advancing deep in the tournament , then we need to keep getting better. But , we will take a win , Bangladesh are a tough team and especially on a wicket like that , it was probably more of sub-continent type of wicket than a New Zealand or Australian wicket as well. Still a really good win , but some areas we need to improve. Everything is alright ( on diving around to stop the ball ) . Just that the boards have got a bit sharpness in them , so cut my hand couple of times. We have to play like that , I have said it time and time again that we need to be throwing ourselves around , we need to be desperate in the field , we need to be trying to save every run. It 's an attitude thing for us , we need to keep showing those and if get injured along the way that 's the way it goes. You have got to bring that to the table and in these sort of competitions and if you are serious about going deep in the tournament. It does n't bother me , does n't bother us who we play. I think if we can reach the levels that we expect of ourselves and put in a real strong performance and then we will be hard to beat. It does n't guarantee us success , but we will be hard to beat. All the teams remaining in the competition have got match-winners throughout , so we need to be on song and we have got a few days now to get over this. Really start to channel our thoughts into the quarter-finals and make sure that we turn up and deliver our best performance of the tournament in that game. " Shakib : " Yes , you can say that. I thought we played really well. Especially the way we batted. Mahmudullah , the way he batted and Soumya Sarkar , they batted really well. I think we bowled really well and kept it tight. It was till the 49th over , that they won the game. That can happen , but we can take a lot of positives from this game and hopefully , this will work in our favour in the quarter-final. He is in great form , but he needs to keep continuing that performance in the quarter-final and hopefully , he will do that , he is in great touch. Some of our boys are in good nick , they are scoring runs regularly. Hopefully , we will contribute with bat and ball and then let 's see what happens. We always knew that we needed some early wickets , we got that but they scored some more runs than what we were expecting. It was always hard for us and especially , we were a bowler short , we did n't have five regular bowlers. So , that was the problem. Otherwise , we bowled really well and kept them tied and in the end , they were the better team today. Yes , after a long time , I did this , yeah enjoyed it ( on captaincy ) . " Guptill : " Yeah , it does feel good mate. It 's a been long time between drinks. But , it has been pretty pleasing to get the runs on the board. I felt pretty good most of the summer , there were couple of innings , where things did n't feel quite fluent. But , I think in Napier and today , it is just getting better. We have got a lot of belief in the team. The way we are playing our cricket and executing our skills , it is very pleasing. We just need to continue on in the next couple of weeks. It is always nice batting with him ( Taylor ) , we started off with a little partnership in Napier and we just sort of carried it along today. He is a quality player and I will learn a lot from him. " Martin Guptill is the Man of the Match New Zealand now will take on one out of West Indies/Ireland/Pakistan in the quarterfinals. Bangladesh have the daunting task of facing up to the form team of the tournament , India , in the quarterfinals . Among the pacers , Trent Boult and Tim Southee produced a fine exhibition of swing/seam bowling with the new ball. Boult was even rewarded with the wickets of Tamim Iqbal and Imrul Kayes , though he came in for some punishment in the end overs. Vettori , the experienced campaigner , put up a fine performance. But Mitchell McClenaghan struggled to make an impact. McCullum again led from the front with his field placements and athletic fielding . Earlier , Mahmudullah twinned measured judgment outside the off-stump and stroke-play to aggregate back-to-back centuries. He became only the second Bangladeshi to score hundreds in successive games in ODIs. Soumya Sarkar and Sabbir Rahman too played useful hands. The New Zealand camp would rue the fact that Corey Anderson dropped a catch when Mahmudullah was on one . For Bangladesh , Shakib picked up four wickets. In fact , it was a good strategy to start with spinners at both ends up front , as Brendon McCullum likes pace on the ball. Shakib even snared the important wickets of McCullum and Kane Williamson. The spinners also extracted a bit of turn. However , the seamers were slightly below par . Ross Taylor gave good support to Guptill. Initially , he struggled for timing , but once he got set , Taylor went right back to play a slew of cut shots. Taylor scored a well-deserved fifty and with it , aggregated 5,000 ODI runs. Once Guptill lost his wicket , Grant Elliott came out all guns blazing. Taylor and Ã‰ lliott were dismissed in quick succession to give Bangladesh genuine hope of coming back into the game. However , Corey Anderson with some lusty blows took New Zealand closer to a win before he was dismissed by Nasir Hossain. It was Daniel Vettori then , who held his nerve to take the home team to a tense victory . Martin Guptill 's splendid hundred and a gutsy knock by Ross Taylor took New Zealand to victory in a game full of fluctuating fortunes. When New Zealand lost the wickets of Brendon McCullum and Kane Williamson against the new ball , they were in a spot of bother. However , Guptill used his feet against Shakib Al Hasan to start his innings on a great note. When the seamers , Rubel Hossain and Taskin Ahmed came into the attack , he played some cracking shots on the back foot. Guptill also showed his ability to use his height to come well-forward and play a couple of shots down the ground against the pacers. He completed his hundred in a mere 88 balls . New Zealand keep their unbeaten run in the tournament intact. Though one must give credit to Bangladesh for running them close. Had it not been for a cool head on Vettori 's shoulder , things might have been different. The New Zealand players come out and shake hands with the Bangladeshi players . 48.5 Shakib to Southee , FOUR , Southee finishes it off in style. New Zealand prevail to pull off a 3 wicket win. It was not all that short , Southee uses the depth of the crease , goes right back and cuts it through cover-point , the timing was sublime as the fielder did n't even bother to chase it 48.4 Shakib to Southee , SIX , terrific shot !

Still no pace on the ball. Remember Rubel cleaned up the tail against England. Might have been worth to give him a go. . 47.6 Nasir Hossain to Vettori , SIX , marvellous shot ! Vettori just showing his range and letting people know he has still got it with the bat. Once again moves away to the leg-side and comes down the track , gives himself some room and lofts it beautifully inside out , he did n't overhit , just relied on timing. At one point , everyone thought he picked out the long-off fielder , but he cleared him comfortably 47.5 Nasir Hossain to Vettori , 2 runs , that is a lovely shot , Vettori backs away to the leg-side and drives it inside out wide of long-off , Sabbir runs across to his right and keeps it down to a couple , Southee had to hurry back to make the ground 47.4 Nasir Hossain to Southee , 1 run , trifle short , Southee goes back and pulls it to deep backward square leg 47.3 Nasir Hossain to Southee , no run , tossed up around off , Southee taps it gently in front of point , Vettori wanted the run but Southee sends him back Tim Southee , right handed bat , comes to the crease 47.2 Nasir Hossain to Corey Anderson , out Bowled ! !

Nasir slowed up and pulled the length back , Anderson was way too early into the slog sweep , misses and the ball hits the top of middle stump.

Shakib hands the responsibilty to the centurion , Mahmudullah 45.6 Nasir Hossain to Corey Anderson , 1 run , Anderson is riding his luck , slower through the air , Anderson goes down on one and for the slog sweep , the ball catches the top edge and balloons over the keeper 's head , wide of the short fine leg fielder as well 45.5 Nasir Hossain to Vettori , 1 run , works it with the angle from round the wicket to mid-wicket , hands the strike back to Anderson 45.4 Nasir Hossain to Vettori , FOUR , fabulous shot !

Tossed up delivery on off , Taylor kneels down and misses the slog sweep , trapped in front of off and middle , ball would have hit the top of midle stump.

Rubel strikes against the run of play ! Taskin is surprised that he took the catch. Guess he was not expecting the ball to reach him on the full. A nice innings from Elliott comes to an end and he is disappointed for throwing it away. Full and plenty of width on offer , Elliott plays the lofted-drive , gets it right off the middle , but picks out sweeper to perfection. Good low catch by Taskin.

No big celebrations as he knows the job is still not complete The crowd cheer as Guptill gets back onto his feet. He is ready to go again. Still stretching though. Ca n't use a runner anymore. The laws do n't allow that. Remember Chandimal went off the other day and his side lost The physio is out there and we have a slight break in play. The players take a breather.

It was Guptill and Ross Taylor , who then played with a mature head on their shoulders to help New Zealand resurrect their fortunes. Guptill also reached his fifty . Here is Bharath Ramaraj 's analysis of the first 17 overs : Bangladesh opened with spinners at both ends. However , Martin Guptill looked to take on the spinners by showcasing good footwork and using the crease to play a volley of fine shots. Brendon McCullum , Guptill 's opening partner , has been in spectacular form in this World Cup. But he tried to play one shot too many and was dismissed by Shakib Al Hasan. Shakib followed it up by taking the wicket of the fulcrum of New Zealand 's batting line-up , Kane Williamson. It was a good strategy to bowl spin at McCullum as New Zealand 's skipper likes pace on the ball . That will be the first drinks break . 16.6 Rubel to Ross Taylor , no run , bumper just outside off , Taylor watches it sail past him 16.5 Rubel to Ross Taylor , no run , good length ball around off , Taylor presents the straight bat and defends to cover 16.4 Rubel to Ross Taylor , no run , short of length on off , Taylor is hurried onto that , he bunts it to cover 16.3 Rubel to Ross Taylor , no run , this time connects with the cut , but no timing on that , chops it to backward point 16.2 Rubel to Ross Taylor , no run , Rubel gets it a bit closer to the off-stump , Taylor presses forward and shoulders arms 16.1 Rubel to Ross Taylor , no run , bit of movement for Rubel , it was short though , Taylor flashes a cut and is beaten. He should have probably let that go Rubel Hossain [ 3.0-0-15-0 ] is back into the attack 15.6 Taskin Ahmed to Guptill , no run , Taskin gets away with one , or we can say Guptill missed out on one. Short and outside off , Guptill square drives it straight to backward point 15.5 Taskin Ahmed to Guptill , no run , good length ball on off , Guptill punches it to mid-on and calls " wait there " 15.4 Taskin Ahmed to Guptill , no run , fuller and holds its line , Guptill went for the clip through the leg-side , closed the bat face little too early , the soft leading edge rolls to the left of Taskin 15.3 Taskin Ahmed to Guptill , FOUR , short and enough room on offer for Guptill to free his arms , he cracks the cut behind point , no chance for the third man fielder to get across and stop the ball 15.2 Taskin Ahmed to Guptill , no run , back of a length around off , Guptill punches it to backward point 15.1 Taskin Ahmed to Guptill , no run , good length ball in the channel around off , Guptill lifts his bat and lets it go 14.6 T Islam to Guptill , 1 run , pitches on leg and turns away , Guptill goes back to defend , the ball squirts off the outside half to sweeper cover 14.5 T Islam to Ross Taylor , 1 run , backs away and provides himself some room to cut it to sweeper cover 14.4 T Islam to Ross Taylor , FOUR , Taylor says enough of nudging and prodding.

And surprise , surprise , it is Shakib to open the attack for Bangladesh. Guptill will take strike first up. The countdown starts and we are all set to get things underway. So , here we go.. . Welcome back.. Bangladesh have not lost to New Zealand in their last 8 games. The Kiwi middle-order has not been tested in the tournament. So , the match is set-up nicely at the moment. And here is a stat that would give the Bangladeshi supporters hope. Rubel Hossain has bowled 10 deliveries to McCullum in ODIs and has got him out thrice , conceding only 7 runs . The track is expected to get slower as the match progresses and the target may prove to be a tricky one to chase down. However , Bangladesh need to be wary of McCullum , as he has been in excellent form in this World Cup . The veteran left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori also made an impression with subtle variations of pace to keep the opposition in check in the middle overs. However , McClenaghan , who replaced the injured Adam Milne had a poor day. New Zealand also would rue the fact that Corey Anderson dropped a chance in the slip cordon to give Mahmudullah a reprieve when he was on one. On his part , Brendon McCullum backed up the pacers and gave them aggressive fields . From Bangladesh 's perspective , one has to remember that Soumya Sarkar counterattacked to lift their sagging morale after they lost wickets up front. He looked to free his arms outside the off-stump and whenever the pacers bowled short and wide , he clobbered it for boundaries square of the wicket on either side. Earlier , it was Boult and Tim Southee , who swung the new ball and extracted movement off the deck on a helpful track to create problems for the openers. Boult then , produced a superb delivery that shaped into the left-handed Imrul Kayes before it moved off the track to uproot the stumps. Boult also sent Tamim Iqbal back to the pavilion . Mahmudullah also showed that he is a street-smart cricketer as when Mitchell McClenaghan came into the attack , he waited for him to bowl a fuller length and played a lofted shot over mid-on in the 25th over. In the slog overs , he showed his class by clouting McClenaghan for a six and followed it up by smashing the same bowler for three more fours in the 47th over. Even Sabbir Rahman gave a good account of himself by thwacking a few eye-catching strokes during the end overs. He thrashed the wayward McClenaghan for a four and a six in the 45th over . Mahmudullah yet again shored up Bangladesh 's innings by compiling his second ton in successive matches to take them to a sizeable total on the board. He only became the second cricketer from Bangladesh to compose back-to-back hundreds in ODIs. After surviving a few nervous moments against the new ball , Mahmudullah , shone brightly by essaying drives and lofted shots. It was in the 14th over of the innings , when he looked to break the shackles by collecting three boundaries off Trent Boult . Mahmudullah is being congratulated by the BlackCaps. The whole of Seddon Park is on their feet applauding the effort from the Bangladeshi. Even when he got to his ton , McCullum and a couple of others clapped. Good sportsmanship shown. They know what a high-quality innings this has been. Also they know that they are in for a fight , perhaps for the first time in this World Cup. Remember they have n't chased over 200 in this World Cup . 49.6 Elliott to Mahmudullah , 1 run , Mahmudullah is early into the leg-side hoick , the ball comes on slower and takes the bottom edge , rolls to mid-off for a single and Bangladesh end on 288 Rubel Hossain , right handed bat , comes to the crease 49.5 Elliott to Nasir Hossain , out Caught by Ross Taylor ! !

The wicket is expected to get slower as the day progresses and Bangladesh look set to post a good total on the board . Soumya Sarkar and Mahmudullah continued to frustrate New Zealand 's pace bowlers. Brendon McCullum introduced Daniel Vettori into the attack and he bowled a few tight overs.

He got the ball to shape it back into the left-handed batsman before it moved away off the track to shatter the stumps. Boult followed it up by sending Tamim back to the pavilion. Tamim has a habit of playing with an angled bat and he paid the price for it. Bangladesh could collect their first runs off Boult 's bowling only in his fourth over. It could have been even better for New Zealand , but Corey Anderson dropped a catch in the slip cordon to give Mahmudullah a reprieve off Southee. In the last game against England , Mahmudullah survived a testing spell from James Anderson upfront , but he had his fair share of luck with a few inside edges and he was reluctant to come forward. Today too he is camping on the back foot. For Bangladesh , Soumya Sarkar looked to take on the challenge of facing up to a quality attack and succeeded by essaying a quick-fire knock. In fact , it was his partnership with Mahmudullah that helped Bangladesh to recover . Southee also has a useful short delivery up his sleeve and he used it to trouble Kayes. Another factor to look at is that Southee bowls this scrambled seam delivery which he uses it as a variation. It was back in 2012 in a Test match in Bangalore when he used it extensively for the first time to take wickets and Sachin Tendulkar was one of the batsmen , who lost his wicket to Southee 's variation . Here is Bharath Ramaraj 's analysis of the first 16 overs : Trent Boult and Tim Southee swung the new ball and also extracted a bit of movement off the deck to trouble Bangladesh 's openers. Boult swung it away from the left-handed batsmen. On the other hand , Southee looked to bowl full and shape it back into the openers , with the odd delivery leaving Imrul Kayes and Tamim Iqbal. He even bowled a cracker of a yorker to Tamim. New Zealand 's pace duo of Southee and Boult generally bowled a fuller length with the new ball and Brendon McCullum backed them up by setting aggressive fields . Drinks are on the field now. The more I see that dive from McCullum in the last over , the more I 'm convinced , that it was totally unnecessary. He so easily could 've done serious harm to himself , either to his hand or to his head/neck while colliding with the ad-board. But that also shows how committed Baz is , not worrying about himself at all. The whole of New Zealand heaved a sigh of relief when McCullum got up unscathed there. New Zealand do n't want to lose their talismanic skipper at this stage of the World Cup. They lost Martin Crowe during the second innings of their semi-final loss to Pakistan. They would n't want history to repeat again . 15.6 Corey Anderson to Soumya Sarkar , no run , good length outside off , Soumya Sarkar gets forward and defends to short cover 15.5 Corey Anderson to Mahmudullah , 1 run , short of length outside off , punched off the back foot to sweeper cover 15.4 Corey Anderson to Mahmudullah , no run , on a length and outside off , Mahmudullah leans into a drive , but hits it straight to the fielder at mid-off 15.3 Corey Anderson to Soumya Sarkar , 1 run , pitched up outside off , Soumya Sarkar plays a cover drive in the air , but straight to the fielder at deep backward point 15.2 Corey Anderson to Mahmudullah , leg byes , 1 run , swinging down leg , off the pad and it 's a leg bye 15.2 Corey Anderson to Mahmudullah , leg byes , 1 run 15.1 Corey Anderson to Soumya Sarkar , 1 run , low full toss outside off , swinging away , Soumya Sarkar reaches out and gets a thick inside edge on the drive , only a single Corey Anderson , left-arm fast medium , comes into the attack 14.6 Vettori to Mahmudullah , no run , slider , skidding on , Mahmudullah punches it back to Vettori 14.5 Vettori to Mahmudullah , no run , on a length and Mahmudullah gets forward to defend to short mid-wicket 14.4 Vettori to Soumya Sarkar , 1 run , Soumya Sarkar gets forward and plays a drive square of the wicket , as Vettori tosses it up outside off 14.3 Vettori to Soumya Sarkar , no run , sliding across Soumya Sarkar on a full length , Soumya Sarkar opens the face of the bat and guides it to short third 14.2 Vettori to Soumya Sarkar , no run , punched off the back foot , but Baz at short mid-wicket is quick to get across 14.1 Vettori to Soumya Sarkar , no run , nudged to short fine , no chance of a quick single Daniel Vettori , left-arm orthodox , comes into the attack 13.6 Boult to Mahmudullah , 2 runs , Mahmudullah tried to pull out of that shot , but was late in doing so , instead he guides it to the right of the diving 2nd slip , half-stopped and it 's another couple Now round the wicket 13.5 Boult to Mahmudullah , FOUR , another boundary !

Guptill comes across and asks him whether he is fine , that was insane from Baz. He was in contact with the ad-cushions as he pulled the ball back , so it 's a four This is crazy from Baz. He is airborne as he dives full length to pull it back Mitchell McClenaghan , left-arm fast medium , comes into the attack 11.6 Boult to Soumya Sarkar , 1 run , shuffles across a tad and flicks a full ball on off and middle to fine leg , retains the strike with that run 11.5 Boult to Soumya Sarkar , FOUR , width was there and Soumya Sarkar threw the bat at that , Sarkar flaying at a wide ball and it 's a one-bounce four to third man 11.4 Boult to Mahmudullah , 1 run , another inside edge as Boult went full , luckily for Mahmudullah , the ball misses leg stump and down to fine leg for a single 11.3 Boult to Mahmudullah , no run , loud shout for lbw from Boult , but that was slipping down leg , was a bit too high too as Mahmudullah got struck on the thigh pad , missed the inside edge as Mahmudullah went for the flick 11.2 Boult to Mahmudullah , no run , full and swinging down , the ball hits the pads of Mahmudullah who flicks and misses , missing leg 11.1 Boult to Mahmudullah , no run , pitched up outside off , Mahmudullah eyes a big drive and inside-edges to the first man at short mid-wicket 10.6 Southee to Soumya Sarkar , FOUR , Soumya Sarkar has a wry smile on his face , after nearly dragging on a harmless full toss , he drives and the inside edge misses leg stump and rattles to the fine leg fence. More disappointment for Southee 10.5 Southee to Mahmudullah , 1 run , wide of the crease , angled in , flicked to fine leg 10.4 Southee to Mahmudullah , no run , what a delivery.

Brilliant bowling 10.3 Southee to Mahmudullah , no run , fullish and swinging in , flicked to short mid-wicket , who dives to his left and stops 10.2 Southee to Mahmudullah , FOUR , dropped by Anderson at 2nd slip. The ball was flying and it burst through his hands. Mahmudullah reaches out and edges the square drive , it was travelling at speed to Anderson 's left , who was slow to react and fails to hang on.

Genius captaincy by Baz Mahmudullah , right handed bat , comes to the crease 9.4 Boult to Tamim , out Caught by Corey Anderson ! ! And there he goes. This time Boult bowled this on a back of a length and on off stump , bit of extra bounce and it held its line , Tamim edged the defensive stroke and a good low take at 2nd slip.

Whoever wins the toss , will look to bowl first . Teams : Bangladesh ( Playing XI ) : Tamim Iqbal , Imrul Kayes , Soumya Sarkar , Mahmudullah , Shakib Al Hasan ( c ) , Mushfiqur Rahim ( w ) , Sabbir Rahman , Nasir Hossain , Taijul Islam , Rubel Hossain , Taskin Ahmed New Zealand ( Playing XI ) : Martin Guptill , Brendon McCullum ( c ) , Kane Williamson , Ross Taylor , Grant Elliott , Corey Anderson , Luke Ronchi ( w ) , Daniel Vettori , Tim Southee , Mitchell McClenaghan , Trent Boult New Zealand have won the toss and have opted to field McCullum : " The first week was quite intense for us. We had three games in seven days. Just had a break which has helped us recover from injuries that we 've had. We have a fully fit team pretty much to pick from today , barring one. Looking forward to today 's game. We are going to have a bowl first. Just seen with the cloud cover , obviously yesterday under covers all day , can tend to swing here as well and the pitch just looks a little bit soft on top and with the day-nighter , it can skid on here later on. They were pretty keen to get first use of the ball ( talking about Boult and Southee ) . They have got a lot of experience at this ground. We have got some fond memories here as well. Hopefully we can turn up today , perform as strongly as we have done in the tournament so far and if we do that , we will give ourselves a good chance in this game. We have got one change , it was n't through illness - Adam Milne after that great catch he took the other day , has jarred his shoulder and Mitch McClenaghan comes in for him. Otherwise , everyone else is good to go. They are a very good side , who are improving every time they come into big tournaments. They have the wood over us when it comes to playing games over in their conditions. Today is an opportunity for us to be able to try and I guess , rectify that record that currently sits. Very respectful of the players that they have got and obviously will be well led by Shakib as well and it will be a good challenge for us. " Shakib : " He has got a little bit of a niggle. We do n't want to take a risk on him ahead of the quarter-final ( talking about Mortaza ) . He is just having a rest. We would 've bowled first as well. Looks to me a good track although a bit of overcast conditions and that will help the bowlers I think. But if we get through the first hour or so , I think it will be a very good track to bat on. We do know that ( on beating New Zealand ) , but it will be obviously difficult for us , but if we play to our potential , anything is possible in ODI games - that 's the beauty of this game. There are two changes - in place of Arafat Sunny , Taijul Islam came in and in place of Mashrafe Mortaza , Nasir Hossain came in " News coming in is that Mortaza is n't playing this game. Shakib will be the captain. We will confirm that for you at the toss Team News : Adam Milne injured his shoulder while trying to take a catch in the previous game against Afghanistan , he has not recovered in time. Hence , New Zealand might play Mitchell McClenaghan. As for Bangladesh , on a slow Hamilton wicket , they might be tempted to play an extra spinner. Stay tuned as the teams and toss are coming up in a short while.. . Weather Check : It has been raining since the last two days in Hamilton. But , the weather looks alright today and we should have a full game. It will be cloudy in the evening , but nothing to worry us . Bangladesh Bangladesh started with a win over Afghanistan. That game was almost like a payback encounter as they had lost to the Asian minnows in the Asia Cup. Their game against Australia was washed out and they were completely outplayed by Sri Lanka. But , they rose to the challenge the Scottish provided them with and chased down the second highest target in World Cups successfully. Nonetheless , their best game was versus England. Even though they were two down for next to nothing , the batsmen put their hands up and took them to a decent total of 275. Then , an inspired Mashrafe Mortaza led the team from the front to win the game by 15 runs . Surprisingly , it is the Bangladeshi pacers who have done most of the damage in this World Cup. The trio of Mortaza , Rubel and Taskin have bowled well together. With Shakib backing them up , it looks a very good attack. Mahmudullah and Rahim have been in terrific form with the bat and the likes of Tamim and Shakib chipping in , it looks like a well settled unit. However , their problems has been the 5th bowler , Mahmudullah and Sabbir Rahman have tried to fill in but without much success. So , this will give them a chance to know their best XI before the knockouts begin . New Zealand The Black Caps have kept their favorites tag intact. Starting with a massive win over Sri Lanka , getting through Scotland , annihilating England , prevailing over arch-rivals Australia and thumping Afghanistan. They have been the form side and one of the only two sides to have remained unbeaten in the tournament , the other being India. Their last game against Afghanistan was a walk in the park , Daniel Vettori ran through the middle order after Boult had given an opening. McCullum got them off to a blistering start , before Taylor and Anderson finised it off with ease . Boult , Southee and Vettori are amongst the top 5 wicket-takers in the World Cup. New Zealand owe their success to those three. They have bowled out opposition for less than 200 in 4 out of 5 games. However , McCullum will be aware that his middle-order has not been tested. The likes of Taylor , Elliott and Ronchi have not spent much time in the middle. So , this game provides the batters an ideal opportunity to have a proper hit . Now , we shall have quick glance regarding the form guide of both the teams. . The two sides met towards the end of 2013 in a bilateral series in Bangladesh. New Zealand headed into the 3-matches series after drawing the Test series 0-0. And it was the Bangladesh who had the better off the Kiwis , beating them 3-0. They also have a stranglehold on the Black Caps in the last 8 games , winning 7 and the other being abandoned. However , all those games were played in Bangladesh and when it comes to World Cups , New Zealand have a 3-0 lead over them. Even Brendon McCullum acknowledged the fact that they were beaten away from home and in unfamiliar conditions. This is what the Kiwi captain had to say before the game , 'I do n't know about payback time. Their performances against us were over in their conditions.' 11 : 45 Local Time , 23 : 45 GMT , 05 : 15 IST : Drama , emotions , joy , disappointment and what not were seen when Bangladesh beat England on Monday at Adelaide. It was for the first time that the Asian team qualified for the knockouts. And they did it in style , beating a lackluster England , who have been shown the door in the World Cup. However , today Bangladesh are up against the favorites , New Zealand and it is not going to be easy. Before we go further , let 's have a look as to what happened when these two teams last met . Preview : During the 1992 World Cup , also held Down Under , New Zealand went on a seven game unbeaten streak before losing the final pool encounter against Pakistan and then losing again to Imran Khan 's 'Cornered Tigers ' in the semi-finals to bow out. There 's a lesson for Brendon McCullum 's men from Martin Crowe 's side - Momentum is everything. Come Friday , at the Seddon Park in Hamilton , they 'll take on a buoyant Bangladesh side fresh after their giant slaying act in Adelaide. While the Black Caps are assured of a top of the table finish irrespective of the outcome , there 's enough in the encounter to keep Bangladesh interested. A win would take them above Sri Lanka in Pool A and help them avoid the other dominant team in the quarters - India. Bangladesh will also have happy memories of playing New Zealand when they swept the bilateral ODI 3-0 the last time New Zealand toured Bangladesh in late 2013 . Team News New Zealand : Since the start of the tournament on February 14th , New Zealand have looked every-bit their annoited tag of 'favourites'. Brendon McCullum 's aggressive captaincy and top-order batting has lit up the tournament. The bowling led by Tim Southee and Trent Boult has blown opposition away for totals less than 200 in four out of their five games. Daniel Vettori has shown that his left-arm spinners remain relevant even in the modern era of power hitting. If there 's an area of concern for New Zealand , it 's the middle-order. Ross Taylor , Grant Elliott and Luke Ronchi have less than 100 runs from the 5 games and are yet to be tested. New Zealand will be hopeful of the trio getting warmed up to the challenges that lie ahead in the knockout phase. An illness broke out in the camp in the last week but McCullum assured in his pre-match press conference that the players have recovered sufficiently. However , Adam Milne , who injured his shoulder while diving to take a catch against Afghanistan , is still sore and is likely to be replaced by left-arm pacer Mitchell McClenaghan . Probable XI : Martin Guptill , Brendon McCullum ( c ) , Kane Williamson , Ross Taylor , Grant Elliott , Corey Anderson , Luke Ronchi ( wk ) , Daniel Vettori , Adam Milne/Mitchell McClenaghan , Tim Southee , Trent Boult Player to watch out for : Ross Taylor - Taylor occupies the crucial No. 4 spot for New Zealand and a batting average of 17.66 with a best of 24 * in 5 games hardly does justice to his talent and batting order. New Zealand will hope for a strong showing from their senior batsman to boost the middle-order . Bangladesh : 'The Tigers ' are fresh from their victory over England that effectively dumped Eoin Morgan 's men out of the World Cup. In New Zealand , they will be up against a significantly better side but that should not stop them from believing a positive result can be achieved. Captain Mashrafe Mortaza , who 's had issues with his knee is also down with a sore throat and maybe rested in a bid to keep him ready for the all-important quarter-final. Mortaza also has an over-rate fine hanging over his head and a rest would allay any fears of the skipper missing out the quarters due to a second breach. Bangladesh could consider playing the extra spinner in Taijul Islam on a Seddon Park surface known to favour the spinners . Probable XI : Tamim Iqbal , Imrul Kayes , Soumya Sarkar , Mahmudullah , Shakib Al Hasan , Mushfiqur Rahim ( wk ) , Sabbir Rahman , Mashrafe Mortaza ( capt ) , Arafat Sunny , Rubel Hossain , Taskin Ahmed Player to watch out for : Tamim Iqbal - The experienced Bangladesh opener has 116 runs in four innings so far , 95 of which came in one game against Scotland. Bangladesh 's middle-order has not received a significant platform from their openers and a strong showing from Tamim will go a long way to remedy that . Pitch and Conditions : Hamilton has received a lot of rainfall in the last two days and there remains every chance that the match might get called off. However , the forecast for Friday is better and a full game might get underway. The Seddon Park in Hamilton is generally known to keep the slower bowlers interested as indicated by MS Dhoni 's use of R Ashwin , Ravindra Jadeja and Suresh Raina in the last game played there. However the short square boundaries ensure that there is no shortage of runs. Batting is known to get easier in the evening under lights and with DLS coming into picture , teams would prefer chasing . Quotes : " He ( Brendon McCullum ) is one of the key players we need to get out early. He 's playing without fear. But , again , we have a few game plans. " ourselves . - Bangladesh coach Chandika Hathurusingha on the keys to doing well against New Zealand . " I do n't know about payback time.
