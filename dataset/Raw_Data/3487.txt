( PTI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 MOHALI : Kings XI Punjab , who had already qualified for the semifinals , kept their slate clean defeating the Cape Cobras by seven wickets in their last league match of the Oppo CLT20 at the PCA stadium on Sunday . The emphatic victory made it four-wins-out-of-four for the Punjab side and they now travel to Hyderabad to play either Chennai Super Kings or Lahore Lions in the last-four stage . Making light work of a 136-run target , Kings XI were home and dry with nearly two overs to spare. Punjab openers Manan Vohra and Virender Sehwag followed talismanic Glenn Maxwell all hit numerically similar 23-run knocks during the chase . The anchor of the innings , though , was wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha ( 42 not out off 35b ; 4x4 , 1x6 ) , who made sure that Kings XI reach the victory mark without further hiccups . Earlier , the Cobras frittered away a great start by openers Hashim Amla and Richard Levi , who put on 60 runs off just six overs. At one point of time , the South African team was well on course for the 200-run mark . But , Kings XI leg-spinner Karanveer Singh lured Amla ( 40 off 22b ; 7x4 , 1x6 ) into a false shot , and David Miller held on to an easy catch at long on . Brief scores : Cape Cobras 135 in 18.3 ovs ( Levi 42 , Amla 40 ; Anureet 3/12 , Akshar Patel 3/15 ) lost to Kings XI Punjab 139/3 in 18.1 ovs ( Saha 42 n.o. , Vohra 23 ) Hobart are first non-IPL team in last four stage Hobart Hurricanes may well end up as the only non-IPL team in the semifinals. They joined Kings XI Punjab in the penultimate round from Group B , when they cantered to a six-wicket win over Barbados Tridents in a low-scoring match . The Tridents batting failed to rise to the occasion as they seemed to be still smarting from the Super Over defeat against Cape Cobras on Friday. They barely managed 113 , after being asked to bat first . Hurricanes too found the going tough as they lost a few early wickets. At 71/4 in 13 overs , it looked like a close affair. But Pakistan all-rounder Shoaib Malik , so used to playing on such wickets , kept one end up and in company of Jonathan Wells , took the team to victory with 10 balls to spare . Brief Scores : Barbados Tridents 113 in 19.4 ovs ( Carter 42 ; Doherty 4/27 , Hilfenhaus 2/14 , Bollinger 2/27 ) lost to Hobart Hurricanes 117/4 in 18.2 ovs ( Malik 39 n.o. , Wells 23 n.o. ) Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
