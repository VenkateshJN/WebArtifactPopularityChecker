Both clubs have accorded the honour to Sourav for his " outstanding contribution " to the game . " I am honoured and delighted to accept the honorary life memberships of these two historic institutions. I started my Test career at Lord 's which houses the MCC and I played my 100th Test at the MCG which is under the Melbourne Cricket Club , so these two venues will always have special place in my heart. And to receive this honour from the two clubs on the same day makes it even more special , " said Sourav , who will be leaving for Australia on Thursday to do TV commentary during the upcoming World Cup . While chief executive Derek Brewer emailed Sourav on behalf of the Marylebone Cricket Club , former Australian Test player Paul Sheahan did the same on behalf of the Melbourne Cricket Club . Sheahan is currently the chairman of the club that was founded in 1838. The MCC , which once used to govern cricket worldwide apart from being the sport 's apex body in England and Wales , was founded in 1787 . The MCC still remains the custodian of the laws that govern the game and revises them from time to time .
