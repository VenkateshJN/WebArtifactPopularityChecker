FC Profile A tall offspinner who extracts substantial turn , Tharindu Kaushal has been perhaps the most exciting young bowler in Sri Lanka 's domestic circuit since he made his debut in early 2013. Working off a distinctive high-kneed approach to the crease , Kaushal uses his wrist , as well as his fingers , to put significant work on the ball - a ploy that is said to make his doosra particularly difficult to pick . Having begun his cricket in Galle 's Devapathiraja College , Kaushal 's debut first-class season was a 20-year old 's dream. In seven matches for Nondescripts Cricket Club , he reaped 50 wickets at an average of 15.20 , and collected six five-wicket hauls. For those efforts , and for a strong List A season , he was picked in two Test squads within 14 months of arriving on the domestic scene , but did not get a game in either series . The bumper hauls continued in 2014 , when he claimed 43 wickets at 23.55 in the Premier League Tournament , and had successful stints in the Sri Lanka A side. Rangana Herath 's unavailability for the Boxing Day Test in New Zealand saw Kaushal named in the Sri Lanka squad for that tour. He made his Test debut in that match . Andrew Fidel Fernando
