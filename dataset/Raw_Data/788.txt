They may keep surprising us ! — Vikram Chandra ( @ vikramchandra ) February 18 , 2015 12 : 46 PM IST : Bangladesh are all out for 267.

Shakib helped steady the slide for Bangladesh © Getty Images 11 : 35 AM IST : Meanwhile , the United States embassy in Kabul seems to have got carried away in their support to the Afghan cricket team. They tweeted two hours ago to congratulate Mohammad Nabi 's side of victory over Bangladesh. Err , the match had only just started back then. But the Americans realised their mistake , albeit an hour later. But they are Americans and their little knowledge of cricket could be forgiven !

The duo have the skills to dig their side out of trouble and post a challenging score on the board . 10 : 22 AM IST : The onus is now on Mahmudullah and Sarkar to bail Bangladesh out of trouble. They were off to a steady start before losing the openers in quick succession. After Tamim had fallen to Mirwais , the bowler came back to strike again , removing the well set Anamul HAque for 29 . Mirwais rocked Bangladesh with two quick wickets © Getty Images 10 : 03 AM IST : WICKET ! Tamim Iqbal perished to Mirwais after helping Bangladesh off to a solid start vs Afghanistan.

Stylish shot from Tamim as Hassan errs in line slightly. This was a rare bad ball and the experienced Tamim was not going to miss out on that . 9 : 15 AM IST : Loud appeal against Tamim off the bowling of Hamid Hassan. The umpire turns it down and Afghanistan decide not to use the DRS. But this has been an excellent start from the Afghan bowlers - Zadran has also been impressive from the other end. Bangladesh 3/0 off 10 overs 9 : 05 AM IST : Hamid Hassan bowls a good , accurate over - Bangladesh opener Anamul and Tamim were watchful to start with ; 2/0 off 1 over . 8 : 34 AM : Bangladesh have won the toss vs Afghanistan and opted to bat in Canberra. The Tigers have made no major changes to their side . 8 : 26 AM IST : Former Sri Lankan player Russell Arnold suggested the team winning the toss should look to at first on the Canberra strip. He and former Pakistan batsman Razmeez Raza said 300 was on the cards today . 8 : 20 AM IST : Afghanistan had won their only ODI vs Bangladesh at the Asia Cup and that too in Bangladesh. That would have hurt the Tigers and undoubtedly would be keen to show who the big brothers are. This should be a cracker of contest . 8 : 07 AM IST : Afghanistan are making their World Cup debut and they could not have asked for a better first match. They take on Bangladesh , a side they had beaten at the Asia Cup last year. Bangladesh , meanwhile , would be eager to shrug off that defeat and focus on getting their campaign off to a great start. So this game , albeit between minnows , should provide plenty of context . Afghanistan all set to trouble the big names . © Getty Images The Manuka Oval in Canberra will be a full house. Like every sub-continental team , Bangladesh too have a firm support base around the world and those fans would flock in to watch Bangladesh grab the advantage in the opening game. Their recent form has been wobbly and if not for a series win against Zimbabwe , Bangladesh 's ODI records would have taken a further dip . Afghanistan , on the other hand , are the darlings of this World Cup. After some eye-catching performances in the Asia Cup last year , the Afghan team is eyeing big upsets Down Under. An opening game against Bangladesh , provides for the perfect opportunity. Interestingly , in the only meeting between these teams , it was the Afghans who pulled one over the Bangla tigers in the Asia Cup . Team in Focus : Afghanistan Afghanistan have made full use of their limited opportunities and have won 24 out of the 45 ODIs that they have featured in. The Afghan team is on a dream odyssey and have nothing to lose. They have come prepared to enjoy their time in the sunshine. However , they are n't mere pushovers. Although , their batting can be a little suspect , their bowling has the required ammunition to trouble most batting line-ups. They have good fast bowlers and an utility spinner in their captain Mohammad Nabi . However , for Afghanistan , it 's all about their spirit. From a war-stricken country to qualify for the World Cup , cricket has acted as a balm on scarred souls. There are in the World Cup to win hearts and a win a Bangladesh , will only enhance their " darling " status . Team in Focus : Bangladesh It 's been a tough ride for Bangladesh on the international scene. Out of the 294 ODIs that they have played , they have managed to go past the line only 85 times. A few years back , they were at least competitive but now , the Bangla tigers roll over too easy. They have had their moments of glory like beating the mighty Australians but those triumphs have been way too sporadic for a Test playing nation. Talent has n't been and issue but Bangladesh , over the years , has failed to harness those talents and build a team around them. Even now , in Shakib-al-Hasan they have one of the best all-rounders in the world , but the others around him have not been able to put their hands up . Against Afghanistan , it 's a tricky opener for Bangladesh. A victory is expected but a slip-up will raise further questions about their pedigree and their Test-playing status .
