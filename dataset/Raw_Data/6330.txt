" I knew I was in for a good day , regardless of the result. # RIPRichieBenaud — Peter Joy ( @ petermjoy ) April 10 , 2015 He was on the air for some of cricket 's most memorable moments @ ESPNcricinfo There are better ones , but " Jones ! Bowden ! " when England won at Edgbaston in 2005 will live with me forever . — James Ash ( @ JamesAsh_89 ) April 10 , 2015 @ ESPNcricinfo " Allan Lamb has been cleaned up , perhaps , so too England " 1992 world cup final . — Waqas ur Rahman ( @ WakasRahman ) April 10 , 2015 @ ESPNcricinfo " You would n't believe it.

" — Akshit Redij ( @ aks_gunner ) April 10 , 2015 Siddarth Ravindran is an assistant editor ( social media ) at ESPNcricinfo © ESPN Sports Media Ltd . OLDEST InsideHedge on April 10 , 2015 , 19 : 35 GMT During a ODI between Eng and Aust at Edgbaston in the early 80s , Rod Marsh had a particularly difficult day behind the stumps. Late in the evening , a stripper ran onto the field only to be grabbed by Marsh and handed over to the stewards/Police. As the broadcast briefly shows Marsh apprehending the stripper , Benaud is at his best with the quip , " It 's the only thing he 's caught all day " . on April 10 , 2015 , 16 : 30 GMT " And that 's four... [ pauses as ball slows up before the boundary ] ...if they can run quickly enough " on April 13 , 2015 , 1 : 45 GMT It is absolutely wrong to compare and difficult to say ( unless you have heard them all ) who were the best. I remember during the playing of the 1960/61 series , listening to Richie 's exploits being described by Alan McGilvray and Johnnie Moyse. There was also an English gentleman by the name of John Arlott. I have learnt that one should be thankful to be alive to hear each person who was very good in his own way. These three mentioned guys were all Radio commentators as far as Barbados was concerned , but you could close your eyes and actually see the game through their voices. I still ca n't say who was best . SoftwareStar on April 12 , 2015 , 18 : 39 GMT MacGill gave it a bit more air , Lara gave it a bit more bat ! After a ( almost ) repeat shot of the previous delivery that again crashed into the cover boundary. Adelaide Test 2000-2001 . Mandafez on April 11 , 2015 , 23 : 04 GMT I remember a highlights package from 1981 ashes when Boycott had been batting all morning and been described as batting slowly. Richie 's take was 'slow is one word for it , tortuous is another' on April 11 , 2015 , 12 : 47 GMT @ ESPNcricinfo From EA sports game commentary " You can not set field for shots like that " on April 11 , 2015 , 10 : 37 GMT " And this is the end of an innings... " From EA Cricket 97 ! Lach-Ferragh on April 11 , 2015 , 8 : 20 GMT Ca n't believe no one mentioned the classic line from the '92 World Cup final following the first of Wasim 's two magical deliveries : " What a great delivery : left arm around the wicket ; Allan Lamb has been cleaned up. Perhaps so too England ! " on April 11 , 2015 , 6 : 14 GMT Subtract lewis from that list. . . Wasim Akram is on a Hat-trick. . . on April 11 , 2015 , 4 : 50 GMT Richie Benaud , Bill Lawry and Tony Greig , the best 3 commentators ever !

Wasim Akram is on a Hat-trick. . . on April 11 , 2015 , 4 : 50 GMT Richie Benaud , Bill Lawry and Tony Greig , the best 3 commentators ever ! landl47 on April 11 , 2015 , 4 : 03 GMT @ James Thompson and Havalina : if Richie ( or for that matter John Arlott ) did say that , he was quoting the late Alan Gibson , who first said it on the air , or Alan Ross , who first said it in print. See Bob Cunis ' obituary in Wisden . It 's still a good line . landl47 on April 11 , 2015 , 3 : 51 GMT What I loved about Richie was his objectivity , even at his own expense. He was talking about the best piece of advice he 'd been given ; Tiger O'Reilly told him to develope a really viciously turning leg-break and that it would take him 4 years to do it. He did so and in turn passed the advice on to Shane Warne . Then there was a typical Benaud pause , before he said in his laconic way " He did it in two " . on April 10 , 2015 , 23 : 53 GMT @ REALMALLORCA Bill Lawry is very much alive my friend ! on April 10 , 2015 , 22 : 24 GMT One line that stands out among the many graceful and beautifully put quotes of Richie is almost uncharacteristic of him. England v Pakistan in 1992 when the camera clearly shows Aqib Javed picking the seam of the ball and Richie says " phwoar ! Steady on ! " havalina on April 10 , 2015 , 19 : 43 GMT @ james Thomson that was Arlott . fanofcricket123 on April 10 , 2015 , 18 : 16 GMT For me , the best is the following. Shane Warne to Basit Ali , 1995/96 Sydney Test , last ball of the day. Result : Bowled around the legs. But , the best is what happened next. Benaud 's quixotic comment : " You would n't believe it. He 's done him between his legs. " RIP pb10677 on April 10 , 2015 , 15 : 50 GMT Cricinfo did an article a few years back about Richie Benaud - and I remember them stating that he had been present at around 36 % of ALL test matches ever played in the history of the game. Either involved as a player or commentator , or simply present as a spectator . If they could update that % as of now , that would be great to know. But approaching 40 % of all matches EVER - dating back to the 1880s. That just shows the dedication and professionalism he exhibited . RIP to a legend - and he WAS a legend . RealMallorca on April 10 , 2015 , 15 : 11 GMT What to say. Another great one departs. First Bill Lawry , then Tony Greig now you Richie Benaud. Golden days of commentary are over ! ! ! ! on April 10 , 2015 , 14 : 39 GMT Of Bob Cunis : 'Funny sort of name Cunis , neither one thing nor the other' . on April 10 , 2015 , 12 : 48 GMT RIP Mr. Benaud. First Tony Greig & now Richie Benaud , the world of cricket commentary is almost orphan now if not completely. You were a great person & your knowledge of cricket was impeccable. I still remember waking up to your voice early morning during world series in 1984-85. You 'll be solely missed , SIR. # Respect swaran on April 10 , 2015 , 12 : 48 GMT Dear Mr.Richie Bernaud , Rest in Peace ! .Cricket world can never forget your honey coated voice in the form of commentary . MasterBlaster100 on April 10 , 2015 , 12 : 45 GMT " And that 's...a dream moment for Chris Smith " He meant nightmare of course. Golden duck on debut poor lad ( 1983 v NZ ) but Richie was n't phased . srini.n on April 10 , 2015 , 12 : 33 GMT Master of under statement...Sachin Tendulkar dropped by Courtney Browne in the 1996 World Cup and the soft voice crooned - " Oh Dear ! " . There will not be another one like him . Gibbke2 on April 10 , 2015 , 12 : 30 GMT In 1985-86 , Greg Matthews was the poster boy of Aus cricket , and they regularly played a clip of his highlights to " Like Wow ! Wipeout " , a song by Australian band The Hoodoo Gurus. After one showing during a break , Richie signed the segment off by plugging the band 's new album at the time...and you need to say this in his voice : " Like Wow ! Wipeout , from their new album Mars Needs Guitars " .. . sach_waz on April 10 , 2015 , 12 : 04 GMT 'If you are sitting at home , make sure you get that in your DVD ' that was when sachin hit a straight drive off lee at MCG in 2008 ODI InsideHedge on April 10 , 2015 , 19 : 35 GMT During a ODI between Eng and Aust at Edgbaston in the early 80s , Rod Marsh had a particularly difficult day behind the stumps.
