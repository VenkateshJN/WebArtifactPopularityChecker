Twitter Reactions : Champions Australia 's unbeaten summer Sun , Mar 29 2015 Last updated on Sunday , 29 March , 2015 , 12 : 17 PM Australia proved to be too good for New Zealand. © AFP Australia were too good a team to get past for India in the semi-final of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015. Co-hosts New Zealand experienced the same in the mega final as the Michael Clarke-led side won by a comfortable margin of seven wickets with 16.5 overs to spare to lift the World Cup for the fifth time. Twitter was abuzz with congratulatory messages for the Australian team while New Zealand 's spirited showing in the tournament also earned them a lot of praise . What is a World Cup ? A tournament which comprises of many teams who compete to lose to Australia in the Finals @ coolfunnytshirt # CWC15 — Hariharan Durairaj ( @ hari_durairaj ) March 29 , 2015 Unbeaten summer at home....take a bow Australian selectors...you blokes have had a blinder...many congratulations to Mick Clarke...patriot ! — Kerry O'Keeffe ( @ kokeeffe49 ) March 29 , 2015 Australia played like Australia and Newzealand played like NewZealand ! # RealityofWorldCup — vikram sathaye ( @ vikramsathaye ) March 29 , 2015 Aus lost only once in this WC...

For Daniel Vettori , who in all likelihood played his final game , his last hurrah did not turn out to be a memorable one . Does anyone do better farewells than Australian cricketers ? It 's like they 're born to say goodbye in style . — Osman Samiuddin ( @ OsmanSamiuddin ) March 29 , 2015 Daniel Vettori is the 1st New Zealander to have an ODI career over 18 years.
