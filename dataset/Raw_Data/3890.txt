( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 MELBOURNE : Indian vice-captain Virat Kohli 's temperament was once again tested after the batsman was hit by a Mitchell Johnson return throw followed by the two players getting into a verbal duel on the third day of the ongoing third Test on Sunday . The drama began in the 83rd over of the Indian innings when Kohli was 16 short of his hundred. Kohli pushed a delivery back to Johnson , who immediately threw it back at the stumps , taking down the batsman inadvertently . The pacer immediately apologised and checked on Kohli but the No. 4 batsman was not amused and fired back with a barrage of verbal volleys . The incident , which happened in between overs , though did seem to have an adverse effect on Kohli who looked shaken and Johnson tried to cash in a couple of overs later . The left-arm pacer did induce an outside edge off the Indian 's bat only to see Shane Watson drop one at first slip. Kohli was on 88 . The stylish batsman went on to register his third century in the series so far , but for a moment it seemed that Australia had once again won the sledging war against the visitors .
