The 24-year-old suffered a side strain in the lead-up to the tournament and missed Australia 's opening win over England in Melbourne on Saturday . " I 'm no chance for Bangladesh , I can tell you that , " Faulkner told reporters in Brisbane on Monday . He was unsure when he might be fit to rejoin the team . " Time 's sort of flown a bit , but hopefully I 'm back sooner rather than later , " he added . Faulkner 's continued absence may ease the pressure on fellow fast bowling all-rounder Shane Watson , whose place is under scrutiny after he was out for a golden duck and failed to take a wicket against England .
