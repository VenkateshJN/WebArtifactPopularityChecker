Do n't mind Kohli blowing flying kiss if he scores ton : Kapil Dev The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Feb 2 , 2015 , 05.02PM IST " If Virat Kohli scores a century and then blows a flying kiss towards his girlfriend , I have no problems , " Kapil Dev said. ( Getty Images ) Page 1 of 4 NEW DELHI : Former India captain Kapil Dev feels that he is fine with Virat Kohli 's antics as long as he is performing on field . " If Virat Kohli scores a century and then blows a flying kiss towards his girlfriend , I have no problems. Rather I have problem if a player scores zero and is blowing a flying kiss. We played cricket in a different era and now its a different era. We have to accept that , " Kapil said at a 'Cricket Conclave ' organized by News24 . " We ca n't just sit back and think that cricket is no longer a gentleman 's game. Times have changed. The generation I played was different. We grew up with Test cricket. But now you have sledging , abuses and T20 is an accepted format. " Kapil also took a sarcastic dig at India 's team huddle which he described as " hug " . " Well I have never understood this team hug inside the ground at start of the match. What were you guys doing in dressing room. Only eating eggs ! " On India 's chances in the World Cup , Kapil said it was 25 percent and also explained his reason for it . " India I believe will reach semifinals and all four semifinalists will have 25 percent chance. You ca n't predict from there on. I believe start is very important. I think the first 15 overs will decide how India will perform. I would take 40/0 in first 15 overs which can give us 270 plus total. It 's a must. But if India lose 2-3 wickets in 15 overs it will be difficult , " Kapil said .
