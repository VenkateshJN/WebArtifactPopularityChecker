Â© Getty Images Napier : Overall team performance helped Pakistan beat the United Arab Emirates by 129 runs in a Pool B game to stay in contention for the World Cup knockouts . Though the margin of victory was quite big , it can hardly be called a convincing win as the 1992 champions failed to bowl out the minnows , who lost their fourth consecutive match . Chasing a monumental 340 at the McLean Park , the expat-loaded UAE were tottering at 25/3 in the 10th over but still managed to end at 210/8 in 50 overs , showing the depth in their batting line-up and the inability of the Pakistani bowlers to bowl out a 'smaller ' team. ( Shahid Afridi Completes 8000 ODI Runs ) From the poor start , UAE arose through Khurram Khan ( 43 ) and Shaiman Anwar 's ( 62 ) significant 83-run fourth-wicket patient partnership. In the process , the Sialkot-born Anwar , who has been in terrific form , scored his second One-Day International ( ODI ) half-century to become the World Cup 's highest scorer with 270 runs from four matches . Later , after the duo got out , wicketkeeper-batsman Swapnil Patil ( 36 ) and Amjad Javed ( 40 ) stuck it out in the middle to help their side play out the 50 overs. ( Complete World Cup Coverage ) Experienced spinner Shahid Afridi ( 2/35 ) was the pick of the bowlers clinching two wickets while pacers Sohail Khan ( 2/54 ) and Wahab Riaz ( 2/54 ) also picked up two wickets each. Rahat Ali was economical , clinching one wicket and giving away only 30 runs from his 10 overs to help Pakistan win their second match in four games . Earlier , Pakistan as a batting unit clicked to post their first 300 plus total of this World Cup when they put up 339/6 . Put in to bat , Pakistan received an early jolt when they lost opener Nasir Jamshed ( 4 ) in the fourth over. But thereon , man-of-the-match Ahmed Shehzad ( 93 ) and Haris Sohail ( 70 ) struck a crucial second-wicket partnership of 160 runs to create the platform for a big total . Shehzad , who has been out of form lately , scored his 11th ODI half-century while Sohail hit his third fifty to set up the innings . Though the duo got out in quick succession , Pakistan did not lose the momentum as the mantle was handled by Sohaib Maqsood ( 45 ) and skipper Misbah-ul-Haq ( 65 ) , who scored his 41st half-century . Towards the end , Afridi 's 7-ball 21 run cameo helped Pakistan go well past the 300-run mark also helping the all-rounder to complete 8,000 ODI runs . It was an average bowling performance by UAE , except for left-arm pacer Manjula Guruge , who picked up the first four-wicket haul of his career , giving away 56 runs from eight overs .
