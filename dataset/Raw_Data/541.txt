De Kock was ruled out of the Tests and limited overs matches of the West Indian tour after tearing ankle ligaments during the first Test at Centurion , which South Africa won by an innings and 220 runs on Saturday . Rossouw , 25 , made his one-day international debut earlier this year and has been a prolific scorer for the Knights franchise and South Africa A . He hit 231 for South Africa A against Australia A in Townsville in August , sharing a partnership of 343 with Temba Bavuma ( 162 ) , who is also in the Test squad . Bavuma was on the field throughout both West Indian innings in Centurion following De Kock 's injury . The selection of Rossouw means that AB de Villiers , who took over as wicketkeeper in Centurion , will keep the gloves for the remaining Tests , starting in Port Elizabeth on December 26 and Cape Town on January 2 . Meanwhile , Windward Islands left-arm seamer Kenroy Peters will replace fast bowler Kemar Roach in the West Indies squad . Roach suffered an ankle injury while bowling in the first Test. Peters , 32 , was the leading wicket-taker in the West Indian domestic four-day competition in 2013/14 . Peters will be the second replacement in the touring squad. It was announced on Saturday that Narsingh Deonarine will replace injured batsman Assad Fudadin Story first published on : Monday , 22 December 2014 09 : 28 IST For the latest Cricket news , Score , like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and get the NDTV Cricket app for Android or iOS
