Sean Williams leads Zimbabwe to stirring win United Arab Emirates vs Zimbabwe , 8th Match , Pool B Thu , Feb 19 2015 by CB Staff Zimbabwe were given quite a scare by UAE , who were playing their first game of World Cup 2015. Chasing 287 , Zimbabwe were in dire straits at 167/5 in the 33rd over before Sean Williams took charge . The left-hander came in at No. 5 and stroked a splendid unbeaten 76 off just 65 balls that helped Zimbabwe beat a spirited UAE. Williams played a vital hand in an 83-run stand with Craig Ervine for the 6th wicket. The duo batted briskly and took Zimbabwe closer to the target before Williams finished things off with three consecutive boundaries in the 48th over . Williams hit his 18th ODI fifty in a knock that was studded with 7 fours and a six. He played the role of a finisher in clinical fashion. Staring at a required run-rate of close to 7 , Williams upped the ante in the batting powerplay hitting two boundaries. However , after the departure of Ervine , he cut loose , hitting a flurry of boundaries after getting to his fifty and ensuring that Zimbabwe were well ahead of the required run-rate . Williams also played a good hand with the ball. He first broke a 78-run fifth wicket stand between Swapnil Patil and Shaiman Anwar by getting rid of the former. Anwar was UAE 's highest scorer in the innings and was looking to cut loose in the death overs when Williams struck again. His stellar show earned him the Man of the Match award as well . A calm and focussed Williams explained that he was trying hard not to feel the scoreboard pressure while chasing . " I tried not to feel the pressure. The coach and I were discussing about playing the sweeps and punches down the ground while building the innings. We focused on having wickets at the end and rotating the strike as much as possible and the plan worked for us , " he said .
