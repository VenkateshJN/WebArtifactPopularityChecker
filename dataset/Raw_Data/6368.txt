Loading comments Tlotoxl on February 18 , 2015 , 16 : 14 GMT It 's not just about the fact that WI lost it is the way they lost , from the reports I heard there was no team spirit , no enthusiasm and they are further hampered by leaving out players for non injury reasons . The 3 worst test teams out of the top 8 are England who despite losing against Aus and probably NZ are playing well enough to qualify , Bangladesh who have won today and WI who have lost to an associate and still have to play SA , Ind and Pak , I ca n't see them winning any of them , with 4 losses it will be very difficult for them to qualify . on February 18 , 2015 , 13 : 48 GMT Hey Very Interesting after one Match West Indies are taken out..How dare you guys say we are not going to make it but I have talk for you,What do you think your words will be when we lift the world cup..The race is not for the swift..Today is mine tomorrow is yours . on February 18 , 2015 , 6 : 55 GMT its amazing nobody said a word and thought : it could be mighty unpredictable PAKISTAN . on February 18 , 2015 , 4 : 54 GMT Common people West Indies just faced only one match. Every one have had bad times in their lifes , it 's a natural thing. Life is not about how had you have been hit , it 's about how well you can recover and fight back. West Indies has that potential they will come back for sure . Popular Videos
