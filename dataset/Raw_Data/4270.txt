Sri Lanka 's Jayawardene ends Test career on a high The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Aug 18 , 2014 , 11.40AM IST Mahela Jayawardene will now play only one-day cricket heading into next year 's World Cup. ( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 COLOMBO : Mahela Jayawardene ended his 17-year Test career on a victorious note on Monday as Sri Lanka won the second and final Test against Pakistan by 105 runs to sweep the series 2-0 . The 37-year-old , who had retired from Twenty20 internationals after Sri Lanka 's title-winning campaign in the World T20 in April , will now play only one-day cricket heading into next year 's World Cup . Sri Lanka 's President Mahinda Rajapakse was among the 4,000 home fans who turned up at Colombo 's Sinhalese Sports Club ( SSC ) to bid goodbye to one of modern cricket 's great batsmen . The elegant right-hander is one of only five batsmen to score more than 11,000 runs in both Test and one-day cricket -- the others being Sachin Tendulkar , Ricky Ponting , Jacques Kallis and teammate Kumar Sangakkara . Jayawardene finished with 11,814 runs in 149 Tests with 34 centuries , but his average dropped from 50.02 to 49.84 after making four and 54 in his final Test at the SSC . He was lifted onto the shoulders of his team-mates as the entire squad did a victory lap of the ground. On his return to the pavilion , Jayawardene was hugged warmly by Rajapakse and other dignitaries . It was at the SSC that Jayawardene scored a monumental 374 during a world-record partnership of 624 with Sangakkara ( 287 ) against a South African attack that included Dale Steyn and Makhya Ntini in 2006 . His 2,921 runs in 27 Tests at the SSC are the most by any batsman at a single ground. He averaged 74.89 at the SSC with 11 centuries and 50 half-centuries . Jayawardene looked good to continue for a few more years after making a fluent 165 against Hashim Amla 's South African team at the SSC last month . He followed that with 59 in the first innings of the first Test against Pakistan in Galle , where he took on the unfamiliar role of an opener in the second knock as Sri Lanka beat fading light and approaching rain to win with 4.4 overs to spare . Jayawardene was also a shrewd captain while leading Sri Lanka in 38 Tests in two phases , the first from 2006 to 2009 and then again for a year in 2012 . Under his leadership , Sri Lanka won 18 Tests , lost 12 and drew eight. As captain , he averaged 59.11 with the bat with 14 centuries . One of the sharpest fielders close to the wicket , Jayawardene 's 205 Test catches are second only to Indian Rahul Dravid 's tally of 210 by a fielder other than a wicket-keeper .
