Pakistan have started their World Cup campaign off on the wrong foot following big defeats to arch-rivals India and West Indies. The team 's fans are already unhappy with the PCB 's functioning and Moin , if proven that he did visit a casino , could bring more flak for the board . " We have launched an investigation over the reports that Moin Khan visited a casino , action will be taken if the reports prove true , " Shaharyar told reporters . " As per initial reports , Moin Khan went there to have a meal two days before the match against West Indies and a Pakistani couple photographed him and made a video . " But we will not make anybody a scapegoat and will investigate this incident before taking any action.
