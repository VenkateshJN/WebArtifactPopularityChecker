Pakistan are also the only team to have won three of their last five World Cup games against Australia. In World Cup knockout games , though , Australia beat Pakistan both times these two teams played each other , the last of them being the 1999 final . 5-1 Australia 's record against Pakistan at the Adelaide Oval. However , the last ten years have seen only one ODI between the two teams at this venue. Australia won that game , in 2010. Australia have won eight of the last 10 ODIs between the teams . 2-4 Australia 's win-loss record at the Adelaide Oval in ODIs since 2011. This is the only venue in Australia where they have lost more matches than they have won . 7 Number of consecutive ODIs Pakistan have lost when chasing targets of 250 or more. The last time they won chasing a 250-plus score was against Sri Lanka last year when they chased down 275. Apart from that , Pakistan have won only one other time chasing 250 or more in 18 attempts since the last World Cup. Their win-loss ratio of 0.13 in such chases is the worst among all teams except Canada , who have three losses from three chases . 58.18 Michael Clarke 's batting average against Pakistan in ODIs. The last time Clarke got out to Pakistan in single digits was in 2009. Since then , he has only one score of less than 25 against them in 12 innings. Clarke has scored 931 with two hundreds and six fifties in 20 innings against Pakistan. Only two of the current Pakistan bowlers - Shahid Afridi and Wahab Riaz - have bowled to Clarke in ODIs. Afridi has conceded 188 runs to Clarke from 248 deliveries and has dismissed him only once . 17.21 Runs per wicket Mitchell Johnson and Mitchell Starc average together against the current Pakistan squad. Johnson has taken nine wickets against them at an average of 18.22 , while Starc has taken five at an average of 15.40. Overall , Johnson has taken 15 wickets at 21.20 runs apiece and Starc has taken 10 wickets in just four matches including one five-for and one four-wicket haul . 8.50 Mitchell Starc 's bowling average in this World Cup. Starc has taken 16 wickets at an economy of 3.67. No other bowler has taken 15 or more wickets in any World Cup at an average of less than 10 . 22.63 Runs the current Pakistan team averages per wicket against Australia in ODIs - the lowest they average against any team. Their strike rate of 76.92 is also their lowest against any team. There have been only 10 fifties scored collectively by Pakistan batsmen in 111 ODI innings against them at an average of 11.1 innings per fifty-plus score , which is the most they take , on an average , against any team to score a fifty . 2 Number of spinners who have taken 50-plus wickets against two or more teams in ODIs. Muttiah Muralitharan has taken 50-plus wickets against five different teams , while Shane Warne has done this against two. Afridi needs just one more wicket against Australia to join the two spinners , and he has 67 wickets against Sri Lanka . 15.77 Younis Khan 's average against Australia in 23 innings - the lowest anyone playing as a batsman ( No. 1 to No. 7 ) has averaged against a team from 20 or more ODI innings. Younis has failed to reach a score of 20 in 17 out of these 23 innings. However , Younis ' last four Test innings against Australia have produced 468 runs including two centuries and one double-hundred. Unfortunately for Pakistan , Afridi also figures in this list . His average of 15.51 against Australia from 29 innings is worse than Younis'. While Younis has one fifty against them in 23 innings that came way back in 2002 , Afridi 's highest against Australia is 48 from his 29 innings batting in the top seven . 57 Highest opening partnership for Australia in this World Cup from five innings , which came against England in the first match. Since then Australia 's first wicket has added 30 , 14 , 19 and 30. Pakistan 's openers have n't done well either , with 172 runs from six innings. Their 120-run stand against Ireland was their first fifty-plus partnership in the World Cup . 49 Number of deliveries bowled by Australia in the last ten overs in this World Cup. In five innings , only two teams have survived to bat into the last ten overs against Australia. England survived only 11 balls after the 40th over , while Sri Lanka batted 38 balls and lost half their side. New Zealand were the only team not to be bowled out by Australia but they were nine down in the 24th over by the time they chased down the target . 4.31 Pakistan 's economy in the batting Powerplays - the best in the tournament so far. Pakistan have taken eight wickets in the batting Powerplays , also the most by any team. Wahab has taken three of these wickets from 51 balls and has conceded 37 runs at an economy of 4.35 .
