Azhar Ali named new Pakistan ODI captain The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Mar 30 , 2015 , 07.17PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 ISLAMABAD : Pakistan 's cricket chiefs on Monday named batsman Azhar Ali as the national side 's new one-day international captain , despite the fact he has not made the 50-over team in more than two years . The 30-year-old replaces Misbah-ul-Haq , who retired from ODIs following Pakistan 's World Cup quarterfinal exit at the hands of eventual champions Australia . Ali has played just 14 ODIs , the most recent in January 2013 , when he contributed two with the bat as Pakistan beat arch-rivals India by 85 runs at Kolkata 's Eden Gardens . He was not even included in the final 15-man World Cup squad , but Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) chairman Shaharyar Khan insisted he had proved himself in the domestic Pentangular Cup . " Azhar Ali has been appointed captain because of his leadership skills , team spirit and character , " Khan told reporters . " I know Azhar Ali was not in the team in the last two years but his performance in the pentangular series proved that he deserves to be the captain. " Ali was also named as vice-captain for the Test side , which Misbah will continue to lead , while big-hitting allrounder Shahid Afridi stays on as Twenty20 skipper . Wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed was named vice-captain for both ODIs and T20s , a move that appears to cement his place in the side . The 27-year-old was left out for the early matches of the World Cup but when he was finally called up , he responded with some dazzling glovework and Pakistan 's first century in the tournament since 2007 in the last group game against Ireland .
