India tour of Australia , 2014-15 ( Full Coverage ) Mitchell Johnson doubtful for Sydney Test against India Sydney , 2015/Jan/02 20 : 45 : 00 Text Size Mitchell Johnson , suffering from hamstring soreness , is in doubt for the fourth Test. © Getty Mitchell Johnson , the spearhead of the Australian pace attack , is in doubt for the fourth Test against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground as he complained of right hamstring soreness. Johnson was not present when the Steve-Smith-led side attended a training session at SCG on Saturday , 3rd January 2015 , ahead of the final Test . Johnson , who has taken 13 wickets in 122.2 overs at an average of just over 35 , had mentioned after the third Test in Melbourne that he will ask Australian skipper , Steven Smith , for a lighter workload in the fourth game.Johnson bowled a total of 38 overs on a flat track in Adelaide and 45.3 overs in Melbourne. Australia have not used the left-arm quick in short bursts like they did during the 5-0 whitewash of England as well as the series victory in South Africa . " Definitely , all us bowlers feel like we need to have a bit of a freshen up. Hopefully I can get a bit of a break at some stage , " Johnson had said , noting the short turnaround before the one-day triangular series with England and India later this month . Johnson 's condition will be assessed closer to the start of the fourth Test , which begins on 6th January. Reports indicate that the left-arm pacer could be rested for the Sydney game and some part of the ODI tri-series in order to remain fresh for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 . Mitchell Starc or Peter Siddle are possible replacements for Johnson if the quick bowler fails to recover in time for the final Test . © Cricbuzz
