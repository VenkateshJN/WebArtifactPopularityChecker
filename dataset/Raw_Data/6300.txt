1 ( 2w ) 12.5 to Rayudu , 132.8 kph , that is a sensational catch from Warner. Rayudu had charged and slashed at the ball , carving it high over the infield on the off side. Warner went after it from cover , I reckon. Running back as the ball swirled away from him but fast enough to get under it and judged it to perfection. He covered so much ground to get under that catch , and he makes a statement to the Indian fans giving him a hard time. 62/2
