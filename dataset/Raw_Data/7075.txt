0 ( 1w ) 19.1 to Thirimanne , 83.8 kph , Tahir goes on a run towards deep midwicket. Huge wicket. Thirimanne is gone. He has looked superb so far. A legbreak from round the wicket , pitches on a length , just outside off , Thirimanne looks for a single to long-on , the ball stops a little. He is early into the shot , the ball has bounced too. Off the high part of the bat it lobs back to the left of Tahir who dashes across Sanga and takes it two-handed 69/3 23.1 to Jayawardene , 94.5 kph , quick , on middle , skids on and Mahela has presented a simple catch to short midiwcket. Du Plessis is elated with the dolly but of course , no one can compare with Tahir 's celebrations. Goes off for another lap of the city. The pressure was piling on and on and out came this shortish delivery. Mahela thought it was the release , but then realised he did not have any room. Was caught in two minds and in the end gave catching practice 81/4 33.4 to NLTC Perera , taken at slip ! Cramps him for room , his slider gets on quickly to Thisara who was trying to back away and punch into the covers. Only ends up with an outside edge that sits snugly in slip 's hands. Had a little pitstop at the keeper 's gloves in between 115/6 37.2 to Malinga , 94.1 kph , tonked straight into cover 's hands ! Tahir has his fourth ! It 's shortish , it has width , it 's been cut with precision to David Miller. 133/10 South Africa innings ( target : 134 runs from 50 overs ) R
