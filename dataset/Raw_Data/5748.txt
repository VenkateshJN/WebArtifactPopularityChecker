Allardice , who was the chairman of the panel that selected the team , said : " The panel had an extremely difficult choice of selecting a 12-member squad at the back of an outstanding tournament , highlighted by some eye-catching individual performances including two double-centuries , 38 centuries , two hat-tricks and 28 four-wicket hauls . " There were a number of other players that were discussed as possible selections in the team. These included batsmen Mahmudullah ( Bangladesh ) and Shaiman Anwar ( UAE ) , fast bowlers Umesh Yadav , Mohammed Shami ( both India ) , Wahab Riaz ( Pakistan ) and spinners Imran Tahir ( South Africa ) and R Ashwin ( India ) . " But there were so many brilliant individual performances during the tournament that it was not possible to fit them into the team. The panel eventually came up with this side , which , in their view , was the most balanced outfit that is capable of beating any side on any given day.
