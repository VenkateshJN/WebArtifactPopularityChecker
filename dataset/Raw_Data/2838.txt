( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 COLOMBO : Sri Lanka stars Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene are facing disciplinary action for their public criticism of cricket board officials in a dispute over their retirement from Twenty20 internationals . Sri Lanka Cricket said in a statement on Tuesday that it decided to refer the " unsubstantiated statements " of the players to the disciplinary committee " for their views and recommendations. " Sangakkara and Jayawardene , on their return home from the World Twenty20 triumph in Bangladesh this month , hit out at board officials who criticized them for announcing their retirement from the shortest format of the game to the media before discussing it with officials . At a news conference arranged at the airport to welcome the team , the two stalwarts said they were only responding to media queries when they said the tournament was their last World Twenty20 and they never mentioned retirement . However , they said SLC secretary Nishantha Ranatunga and chief executive Ashley de Silva criticized them in the media without ascertaining if they really made such a statement . The two players played crucial hands in the final against India , and Sangakkara 's match-winning half century won him the player of the match award . Both players subsequently handed letters of resignation from T20 internationals to the cricket board . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
