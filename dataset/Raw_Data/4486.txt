World Cup 2015 : Aussies press rewind to boost fielding The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Mar 16 , 2015 , 10.55AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 ADELAIDE : Australia are stepping back in time in an effort to maximise their chances of a fifth World Cup title by dusting off old videos of fielding master classes . The team 's fielding coach , Greg Blewett , believes sharpness in the field will be key in Friday 's quarterfinal against Pakistan at the Adelaide Oval . " Over the last month or so we 've shown a fair bit of footage of some really good Australian fielders who have gone before these guys , " Blewett said . " It 's about them hopefully starting to replicate a bit of what guys like Andrew Symonds , Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden ( achieved ) . " Trying to get them to force a bit of their own legacy. The other thing is trying to create a bit of competition amongst the guys at training. " Improving Australia 's performance in the field has been high on the agenda since coach Darren Lehmann labelled it " shoddy at best " after a handful of chances went down in the Boxing Day Test against India . Lehmann reckoned that the World Cup would probably be won by the best fielding side . " The three best fielding sides are South Africa , New Zealand and us , " said Blewett , who played 46 Tests and 32 ODIs in his career . " We 're all pretty close. Everyone knows how important fielding is , particularly when it comes to the bigger games. " Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
