Brilliant Sangakkara sets up Sri Lankan win He breaks wicketkeeping record as team concludes ODI series with 34-run victory over New Zealand Share this article : Kumar Sangakkara scored 113 off 105 balls helping Sri Lanka post 287 for 6 . A crafty 113 off 105 balls from Kumar Sangakkara helped Sri Lanka register a 34-run win over New Zealand in the seventh and final One-Day International between the two sides in Wellington on Thursday ( January 29 ) . New Zealand had already sealed the series , but the moral-boosting win meant Sri Lanka took the scoreline to 4-2 . Sri Lanka reached its highest score of the series , scoring 287 for 6 in 50 overs and then shot down New Zealand for 253 in 45.2 overs. And when Sangakkara took a superb diving one-handed catch to remove Corey Anderson , he became the most successful ODI keeper. It was his 473rd dismissal , bettering Adam Gilchrist ’ s record by one . Sangakkara added 104 runs with Tillakaratne Dilshan ( 81 ) after Lahiru Thirimanne ( 30 ) and Dilshan got the visiting side off to a steady start with 71 runs for the first wicket in 15 overs. However , once Dilshan was dismissed caught behind in the 33rd over by Tim Southee , there were no other significant partnerships. Thisara Perera smashed a helpful 20 off 12 balls , but Sri Lanka could manage just 112 runs in the last 17.1 overs , with Sangakkara and Nuwan Kulasekara ( 12 n.o. ) added 34 runs in the last 4.2 overs . Sangakkara ’ s 21st ODI century , off 105 deliveries , moved him to within 11 runs of Ricky Ponting as the second-most prolific batsman in ODI history . In reply , New Zealand lost opener Martin Guptill off the first ball of the innings when Kulasekara trapped him lbw. Tom Latham , in for a rested Brendon McCullum , failed to get going and was bowled by Shaminda Eranga for six . With the scorecard reading 11 for 2 , New Zealand was in dire need of a partnership. Ross Taylor and Kane Williamson added 31 runs for the third wicket , but the alliance couldn ’ t last long with debutant Dushmantha Chameera claiming the wicket of Ross Taylor with his sixth delivery . Kane Williamson , with a cautious 54 from 83 deliveries , top-scored for New Zealand. Luke Ronchi and Daniel Vettori tried to revive the innings with a 74-run stand for the seventh wicket , but Kulasekara bowled Ronchi to quash any hopes of a New Zealand win . New Zealand will face Sri Lanka in the opening match of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 at the Hagley Ovel in Christchurch on February 14 .
