A match that had meandered for much of a steamy day at Melbourne 's Junction Oval sprang to life late in the afternoon as the dogged Emiratis scrambled hard to reel in their opponents ' 308-9 . All-rounders Rohan Mustafa ( 24 ) and Amjad Javed ( 18 ) mounted a lusty eighth wicket stand to push UAE within 20 runs of victory , but paceman Dawlat Zadran intervened to bowl Javed and the Middle Eastern minnows succumbed quickly thereafter . Paceman Aftab Alam took 3-43 from his 6.2 overs to be the pick of the Afghanistan bowlers , including the match-winning wicket of tail-ender Saqlain Haider for one . All-rounder Javed , one of the few home-grown Emirati players in the side and an airline cargo supervisor away from the game , took 4-39 to lead the UAE bowling . Left-handed batsman Khurram Khan , the team 's 43-year-old talisman , sparkled with an 86 before being trapped lbw by Alam . Afghanistan were on the back foot early on a steamy day at the Junction Oval and slumped to 50-3 when Javed removed number three batsman Nawroz Mangal for 16 after also capturing opener Javed Ahmadi for 12 . Samiullah Shenwari steadied the innings with a controlled 58 , allowing fellow middle order batsman Najibullah Zadran ( 46 ) and all-rounder Mirwais Ashraf ( 34 not out ) to set up an imposing total . Afghanistan will head to Canberra seeking to upset Bangladesh in their World Cup opener on Feb. 18 , while UAE take on Zimbabwe in Nelson , New Zealand the day after .
