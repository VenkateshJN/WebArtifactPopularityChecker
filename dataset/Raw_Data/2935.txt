Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 Farhaan Behardien , who scored a quick-fire 64 not out , and Vernon Philander ( 10 ) took South Africa past 300 , which should be enough for a victory that will qualify them for the quarterfinals in second place in the group behind unbeaten India . De Villiers ' side are on six points and have had an inconsistent tournament , posting totals in excess of 400 twice but also losing their nerve chasing against India and Pakistan . Hashim Amla began positively enough after Mohammad Tauqir had won the toss and opted to field , with the South African opening batsman belting Mohammad Naveed for two boundaries . He was then struck on the right wrist by a high full toss and despite playing on after receiving on-field medical treatment , did not last much longer when he mistimed a short Naveed delivery and was caught by Amjad Ali for 12 . Quinton de Kock , who was in desperate need of a long innings , scratched around for 45 balls and was the junior partner in a 68-run partnership with Rilee Rossouw before he was caught by wicketkeeper Saqlain Haider off Amjad Javed for 26 . Rossouw was then deceived by a Tauqir slower ball and hit it straight back to the UAE captain to be caught and bowled for 43 , bringing Miller and De Villiers together for the most significant partnership of the innings . Both fell short of milestones with Miller bowled by Naveed for 49 , while De Villiers surprisingly hit the ball straight to Javed at short third man as he attempted to pass three figures .
