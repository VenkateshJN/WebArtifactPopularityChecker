" I played my second one-dayer and got my first wicket here so I am sure spinners will do well , " said Kalpage , who took 73 wickets in 86 one-day internationals for Sri Lanka . Kalpage admitted the current tournament was tough for bowlers as totals over 300 are becoming a regular occurrence . " Not only for Bangladeshi bowlers but it has been tough for all bowlers in this tournament , " said Kalpage . " We already have totals of 300 and more so I think when you come to watch cricket people like to see big scores and the top four score big hundreds. Only in some matches have the bowlers done well. " Kalpage agreed that removing New Zealand skipper and opener Brendon McCullum , who has three fifties in five games so far , will be key . " It will be tough for our bowlers but we have a plan for him. We want to see Brendon and Kane ( Williamson ) get out early , " said Kalpage , who also singled out left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori as a dangerman . " He ( Vettori ) has proved that he is the best spin bowler in the world , he has got 300 wickets so New Zealand are very happy to have him in the team after injury . " He is more effective against right-handers and we have a combination of left and right so it will be a good test for him going into the quarter-finals.
