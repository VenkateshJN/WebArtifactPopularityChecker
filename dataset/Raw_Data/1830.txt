Prodigal Mumbai go down tamely against Saurashtra The author has posted comments on this article Tushar Dutt , TNN | Mar 27 , 2015 , 10.48AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 PUNE : When Mumbai 's No. 9 batsman Shardul Thakur was approaching the pitch , he had Abhishek Nayar 's message for Surya Kumar Yadav , who was at the other end : " Take the game as far as you can. " Mumbai were chasing Saurashtra 's 177 and Yadav remained unbeaten at 37 , but he could n't stretch it beyond 116-9 in 20 overs on Thursday. Mumbai , hence , lost by 61 runs . This is Mumbai 's first defeat in three games and Saurashtra 's second win in as many matches of Inter-zone T20 tournament played at the MCA stadium in Gahunje . Choosing to bat first after winning the toss , Saurashtra rode on the collective effort of their top-or der batsmen. Openers Sheldon Jackson ( 53 ) and Cheteshwar Pujara ( 28 ) stitched together a 63-run opening partnership. Jaydev Shah ( 39 ) and Chirag Jani ( 36 ) too played their part to take Saurashtra 's score to 177-4 in 20 0vers. While chasing a 170-plus target was always difficult under the lights , some irresponsible shots by the middle order and excellent fielding by Saurashtra fielders took the game away from Mumbai . Opener Aditya Tare ( 14 ) was the first to go , when the team 's total was only 27. Shreyas Iyer ( 3 ) and Shoaib Shaikh 's ( 19 ) wickets made it 40-3 . The Mumbai think-tank promoted Siddhesh Lad up the order , but that did n't work either , as the youngster was dismissed for 19 . On the other hand , Saurashtra bowers kept the runs in checkand forced them to play big shots. In the process , the Mumbai batsmen fell to some good field placement and some fine catching in the outfield. Out of the nine batsmen Mumbai lost , seven were out caught. Jani , along with Dharmendrasinh Jadeja and Arpit Vasavada took two wikets each . Brief scores : Saurashtra : 177 ( Sheldon Jackson 53 , Jaydev Shah 39 , Chirag Jani 36 ; Shardul Thakur 2-51 ) beat Mumbai : 116-9 ( Surya Kumar Yadav 37 ; Chirag Jani 2-11 , A Vasavada 2-17 , D Jadeja 2-24 ) by 61 runs .
