With three deliveries left in the innings , Finn dismissed Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin for 31 when he top edged a catch to Stuart Broad at deep third man . Off the next ball , Glenn Maxwell , who crossed during Haddin 's deflection , departed for 66 when he was brilliantly caught by a diving Joe Root at long off . Then off the final ball of the innings , Mitchell Johnson slapped the ball straight to Jimmy Anderson at mid-off , giving Finn an unexpected hat-trick and figures of 5-71 . Finn became just the seventh player to take a hat-trick at a World Cup . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
