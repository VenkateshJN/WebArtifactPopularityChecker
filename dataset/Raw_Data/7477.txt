I agree that it was too long and could easily be reduced if they had two matches a day. The Associates added to the interest and should be retained in future tournaments. The 1992 format was not the best format ! This 1992 format does n't explain why we need to have semi-finals and a final. If all the teams play against each other , then the team that tops the group should be declared the World Champion. This is the team , after all , who has topped the group after every top nation has played against each other. There is no point in having semi-finals and a final. The other problem is that with the 1992 format , a team could lose 4-5 games , sneak into the semis and suddenly win the tournament. How does this make it the best format ? The proposed 2019 will also drag and will actually be longer than this edition . March 17 , 2015 , 5 : 01 GMT By calebmatthews99 The tournament has been good. I think keeping it this format gives lower quality sides a chance to prove their worth , as well as having a challenging schedule for all teams to win it March 17 , 2015 , 3 : 36 GMT By siddiqimali This world cup has produced only few matches of interest as ODI and T20 are heavily in favour of Batsmen. With smaller boundaries , batting wickets , two new balls , more meaty bats have shifted the pendulum towards batsman. Some more , no ball resulted in free hit has been icing in the cake as batsman can not be given out on the no ball itself and the next ball , he get license to hit as he can not lose his wicket as well. T20 has played a major role in batsmen developing greater improvisation. Also , mostly in day night games , batting first and posting a 300 + total makes it difficult for the team batting second as scoreboard pressure , bowling in the heat and chasing the leather worn down the side batting second. At least , more sporting wickets can make the game even and more interesting as low scoring thrillers are more exciting than chasing leather for the whole 100 overs. Aus vs NZ match stands out followed by Pak vs RSA For Associates , Zim vs Ire and Afghanistan vs Scotland March 17 , 2015 , 1 : 37 GMT By The worst World cup until now. The dead pitch , nothing for bowlers in most of the games only mental pressure. ICC must think of bowlers also because bowlers are one of the most important part of cricket. See , scoring 350 , 400 in very easy manner , if so why you need bowler , keep batsmen who can bowl , because the game now is for batsman only.. . March 16 , 2015 , 20 : 30 GMT By Overall , yes the World Cup group stages was one of the best ones in recent memory. However , if you think about it , statistics are often swayed because of results to certain nations - meaning - if you ask anyone how 2003 World Cup was , I guarantee the " majority " will say it was excellent because India did well. Same goes for 2015. However , without being too harsh , the matches , spirit , grounds , scores , quality has been top notch. Associates could have been reduced by 2 ( UAE and Scotland ) . Other than that , I 'd say - great job Australia and New Zealand as hosts. Lets bring on the knockouts. If India loses early , the tournament will be deemed a massive failure and people will pin it on burn out with added associates - if India wins , the Associates will survive - its wierd , but true . March 18 , 2015 , 10 : 07 GMT By My answer is NO. I still believe that the 1992 format was the best. In a round robin tournament you get to see all the top sides go head to head. That 's what people want to see. Unfortunately to have a 12 team round robin will result in 66 group matches , which is insane. So to limit the number of teams to 10 and give the associates a chance of competing , I would suggest that teams rated 1-8 on the ICC ODI rankings , be given automatic qualification to the World Cup. The other 2 will compete against the associates in a pre World Cup league format to decide which 2 teams will join the World Cup. The 10 teams will then compete in a 1992 format , which is 45 group games , 2 semis and the final with 2 spare days. One for the semi finals and one for the final. Total 48 games . March 17 , 2015 , 10 : 13 GMT By bobpeecee Too boring and too long. Group stages should have been completed in three weeks. Six games per team in the group stage over 21 days should be possible. That 's 42 matches at 2 per day. It should be possible to schedule a major and minor match per day. Follow it up with a couple of weeks of elimination matches and a final. Will be much more interesting Make the second round a round robin as well and let the top team in each group carry two points so that 's 12 matches in the second round if four teams advance as currently. Followed by a semi-final and final. More entertaining and more revenue generating as India will get at least 3 more matches in the second round . March 17 , 2015 , 9 : 31 GMT By Gobhav This is the most boring tournament , that I witnessed from 1987 onward. Only NZ - AUS game was worth the salt - should I say pitch ? The team batting first scoring 300 or so predictably wins the match , including PAK - SA match. I would prefer scores of 250 to 280 , favoring both teams. There is nothing , absolutely nothing for the bowlers , going to be endangered species very soon. I would sum up the group stages as ODI , in T 20 style . March 17 , 2015 , 8 : 09 GMT By nspkarthick As there were only 3 top Teams in each pool , Matches between associates and Top 3 were very much one sided apart from a rare match like SL Vs AFG ! Format can be revived back to 2003 's where " super 6 " rounds allowed more exciting matches ! This format was easily predictable as any one who knows cricket would have easily said the qualifying Teams ! March 17 , 2015 , 4 : 58 GMT By AlpiBhalla The very flawed format ensured that the answer is NO Related Links
