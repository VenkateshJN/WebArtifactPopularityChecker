Mathews , Herath set to feature in Sri Lanka 's quarterfinal Thu , Mar 12 2015 Last updated on Thursday , 12 March , 2015 , 12 : 44 PM Mathews suffered an Achilles injury against Scotland. © AFP Injury doubts Angelo Mathews and Rangana Herath are all set to play Sri Lanka 's ICC World Cup quarterfinal , giving the team 's chances a big boost. Sri Lanka captain Mathews suffered an Achilles injury in the team 's last Pool A game against Scotland on Wednesday and after scoring a 22-ball 51 opted to sit out of its successful defence of 363 for 9 . " I 've got a sore Achilles tendon , so management thought it would be wise for me to stay out of the field as a precautionary measure. I do n't think I will be out , but we will have to assess it over the next couple of days , " Mathews had said at the post-match presentation , fuelling speculation . However , a report on cricket.com.au on Thursday put paid to any doubts regarding the fitness of the big-hitting allrounder. " A team spokesman told cricket.com.au , he was " 100 per cent sure " Mathews would be fit for their quarter-final , adding the skipper had not been sent for scans , contrary to media reports , " the official Cricket Australia website said . Also , 36-year-old left-arm spinner Herath has very much recovered from a finger injury that prevented him from playing against Australia and Scotland , if one believes Sri Lanka opener Lahiru Thirimanne. " I think he has about an 80 per cent chance of playing in the quarter-final. I feel he will be fit , " Thirimanne had said after the win over Scotland . Sri Lanka are likely to play South Africa in the first quarterfinal at the Sydney Cricket Ground on March 18 . © Cricbuzz ( with inputs from agencies ) Tags
