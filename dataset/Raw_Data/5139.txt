Clarke , who had just led the co-hosts to a crushing 95-run win against the defending champions , was facing the media at the post-match press conference at the Sydney Cricket Ground , when he was asked to comment on " the tremendous sex " he had enjoyed since taking over as captain . The embarrassed reporter quickly corrected himself , telling Clarke he had meant to say " the tremendous success " . " How well do you know me ? " Clarke asked the journalist as man-of-the-match Steve Smith , who was sitting next to him , laughed. " It 's a question for my wife , " said the skipper .
