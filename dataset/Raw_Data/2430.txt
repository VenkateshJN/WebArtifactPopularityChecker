( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 SOUTHAMPTON : India still needed 47 runs to avoid the embarrrassment of a follow-on after pathetic shot selection by some of the top-order batsmen , which allowed England to tighten their grip on the third cricket Test on Tuesday . At stumps , India were precariously placed at 323 for eight , with skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni waging a lone battle with a gritty half-century . Almost all the Indian batsmen got starts but failed to convert into a big score which is required while chasing a mammoth first innings score . India are still 246 runs behind England 's first innings score of 569 for seven . At stumps Dhoni ( 50 batting ) and Mohammed Shami ( 4 batting ) were at the crease battling to keep India in this Test match with two full days to go . James Anderson ( 3/52 ) and Stuart Broad ( 3/65 ) hunted in pair while Moeen Ali ( 2/62 ) was a beneficiary of poor shotmaking by a couple of Indian players . It was terible shot selection that brought about the downfall of Rohit Sharma ( 28 ) and Ajinkya Rahane ( 54 ) , both of whom looked set for long haul . Rohit after a 74-run stand with Rahane was guilty of charging down to part-time off-spinner Ali failing to clear Stuart Broad at mid-off . Rahane , who scored a gutsy half-century after a fine spell from Broad in the pre-lunch session , mishit a half-tracker from Ali to be caught by substitute fielder Sean Terry at mid-on. Rahane hit five boundaries in his 113 ball knock and his dismissal proved costly in the broader context of the Indian innings .
