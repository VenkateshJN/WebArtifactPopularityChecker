'Dhoni had assured Vijay of World Cup berth' Thu , Jan 08 2015 by Dwaipayan Datta Last updated on Thursday , 08 January , 2015 , 10 : 35 AM A source close to Murali Vijay has revealed that the batsman was assured of a World Cup spot by India captain MS Dhoni . Murali Vijay missed out on a World Cup berth as the selectors preferred allrounder Stuart Binny. © TNN Murali Vijay 's body language betrayed disappointment at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Wednesday. He had every right to feel disappointed after being ignored for the World Cup squad that was picked on Tuesday. One understands that Vijay was skipper MS Dhoni 's choice as one of the back-up batsmen but the selectors were absolutely adamant on Stuart Binny 's inclusion . A source close to Vijay told TOI that the batsman was told by Dhoni during the course of the ongoing series that he would be part of the team for the World Cup. " That 's why he was extremely upbeat for the last month. The disappointment is understandable , " the source said . Vijay has scored 402 runs in four matches so far at an average of 54.32 and the captain did his best to have the opener in the squad as a back-up for Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma. Coach Duncan Fletcher , too , had put in a word for Vijay but the selectors felt that allrounder Binny would be more suitable than an extra batsman and Vijay had to miss out . While the skipper had his way on Ravindra Jadeja and Dhawan , Mohit Sharma is another bowler who was not given the nod despite the skipper 's preference. " Dhoni had prepared Mohit with the World Cup in mind. An injury sometime back did n't go in his favour , but he was still fit and the captain would have liked to have him in the team , " the source added . © TNN
