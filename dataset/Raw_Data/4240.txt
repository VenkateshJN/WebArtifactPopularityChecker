Mumbai 's win saw a confident 71-ball 110 by opener Shoaib Shaikh. Batting first , Mumbai made 179-5. It was a free flow for Shaikh . The 28-year-old , who had scored 58 against Baroda in their first match , looked in good touch with eight fours and four sixes. He shared a 75-run opening stand with skipper Aditya Tare ( 30 ) and then a 48-run partnership with Shreyas Iyer . Gujarat got off to a bad start. It was Siddhesh Lad who set the tone for Mumbai bowlers by getting Parthiv Patel ( 8 ) cheaply in the second over. Gujarat had only 10 runs on board then . Another opener Priyank Panchal was next to go on the first ball of the third over. This time the bowler was Shardul Thakur but Gujarat were still at 10 . Thakur dismissed Chirag Gandhi for a duck in the third over , leaving Gujarat helpless at 10-3. Leg-spinner Pravin Tambe took two wickets for 10 runs. After hurting Gujarat early , rest was a formality. Parthiv 's boys crawled to 87-8 in 20 overs . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
