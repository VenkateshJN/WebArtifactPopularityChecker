( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 NEW DELHI : Retired great Sachin Tendulkar says Sunday 's World Cup game against Pakistan could pose a challenge to the Indian team that is bigger than even playing in the final . " The Pakistan game was a high pressure game compared to the final , " Tendulkar said in an interview on Headlines Today news channel about India 's win over its arch-rival in the 2011 semifinal at Mohali in which he scored a match-winning 85. " It 's a different atmosphere altogether. " India start their defense of the World Cup against Pakistan at Adelaide on Sunday. It will be the first time that India will be without Tendulkar for a World Cup game against Pakistan , which has lost all its five Cup games to India . The two countries did not meet in the first four editions of the World Cup , with an 18-year-old Tendulkar scoring a half-century in their first encounter in 1992. Though Pakistan lost that match , it went on to win the title . Tendulkar , who retired in 2013 , figured in six World Cups and is the most prolific batsman in the tournament 's history with 2,278 runs in 45 matches . He aggregated 482 runs at the 2011 World Cup and 673 in 2003 , when India finished runner-up to Australia. He also scored 523 runs when India reached the semifinals in 1996 . Tendulkar was declared man of the series at the 2003 edition in which he smashed a memorable 75-ball 98 against Pakistan in a match best remembered for his slashed six over third-man off speedster Shoaib Akhtar . " A Pakistan game is not only about that day. I remember 2003 , when we played Pakistan at Centurion , my friends had started talking about it 10 months before that , " said Tendulkar , who finished with a record 15,921 runs and 51 centuries in 200 tests and 18,426 runs with 49 centuries in 463 one-day internationals . Tendulkar , who realized a long-time dream when India lifted the trophy beating Sri Lanka at his home ground Wankhede Stadium , said he had considered retiring after India 's first-round exit in 2007 in the West Indies . " When I came back home , I was so depressed and so upset with the way we had performed. I actually thought of retiring then. I called my brother Ajit over and told him that I do not want to continue. The game has been cruel to us and I want to stop , " he said . But Tendulkar said it was Ajit who motivated him to continue with the aim of winning the World Cup at home four years later .
