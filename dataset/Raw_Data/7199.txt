How often has this happened in a series ? asked Varun Rao from the United States It is fairly unusual for both teams to change captains in successive Tests in mid-series : the recent instance - in which MS Dhoni returned for Virat Kohli in Brisbane , while Steve Smith replaced the injured Michael Clarke - is only the eighth occasion that it has happened. The first was back in 1888-89 , when Owen Dunell captained South Africa in their inaugural TestA , and William Milton in the second ; Aubrey Smith then Monty Bowden captained England. In the 1926 Ashes series Arthur Carr skippered England in the fourth Test , and Percy Chapman in the fifth at The Oval , where tour captain Herbie Collins returned for Australia , who had been led by Warren Bardsley in the fourth Test. The skippers in the first Test of the 1947-48 West Indies-England series were George Headley and Ken Cranston ( both captaining for the only time ) , while Gerry Gomez and Gubby Allen tossed up in the second . In the 1961 Ashes Colin Cowdrey and Neil Harvey led at Lord 's , with Peter May and Richie Benaud returning for the third Test . Cowdrey was involved in the next instance , too , in 1968 : he and Australia 's tour captain Bill Lawry skippered in the third Test , but both were injured for the next one , in which Tom Graveney and Barry Jarman both had their only taste of Test captaincy. Cowdrey and Lawry returned for the fifth Test at The Oval , in another double switch. It happened again in England 's series in the West Indies in 1989-90 : Desmond Haynes and Graham Gooch skippered in the third Test , but Viv Richards returned for the fourth , while Allan Lamb replaced the injured Gooch. And finally , Mike Atherton and Steve Waugh captained in the third Test of the 2001 Ashes , but Nasser Hussain and Adam Gilchrist took charge for the fourth . Faf du Plessis was dismissed for a duck for the first time in international cricket at Centurion. Who now holds the record for the most international runs without a duck ? asked Ricky Dooley from Belgium Faf du Plessis did indeed bag his first international duck in the first Test against West Indies in Centurion , in what was , rather neatly , his 100th match in all three formats. In 107 previous innings he had scored 3707 runs with no ducks , a record previously held by his team-mate AB de Villiers , who made 2681 runs in 84 innings before falling for 0 in his 63rd international match , against Netherlands in St Kitts during the 2007 World Cup. The current player with the most international runs but no ducks is Chris Rogers , the Australian opener , with 1258 ( all in Tests ) . But he 's only just ahead of a rather more surprising name : the Afghanistan allrounder Samiullah Shenwari has n't yet been dismissed for 0 in 55 international innings , which have brought him 1253 runs . With the World Cup looming Down Under , who have been the most successful batsmen in Australia in ODIs , by runs scored and by average ? asked Liam Parker from England Two distinguished West Indians lead the way in aggregate terms : Desmond Haynes scored 3067 runs in one-day internationals in Australia , and Viv Richards 2769. There 's a long gap after that to Javed Miandad ( 1913 ) and Brian Lara ( 1901 ) . Haynes played no fewer than 94 ODIs in Australia , 20 more than any other visiting player ( Richie Richardson is next , with 74 ) . The leader on average , given a minimum of ten innings , is Geoff Boycott , with 63.37 , just ahead of MS Dhoni ( 61.33 ) . Peter Kirsten ( 52.75 ) and Neil Fairbrother ( 51.69 ) also averaged over 50. If you raise the bar to 25 innings , then Richards ( 44.66 ) leads the way from Clive Lloyd ( 43.61 ) and Gordon Greenidge ( 43.27 ) . Only eight home players have scored more runs than Haynes in ODIs in Australia : Ricky Ponting leads the way with 5406 , while Michael Bevan has the highest average ( 55.86 ) . What 's the best bowling by someone in a one-day international on his birthday ? asked Clive Johnstone from Australia The best birthday figures in one-day internationals were recorded by someone who was also making his debut : South Africa 's Vernon Philander took 4 for 12 against Ireland in Belfast on his 22nd birthday in June 2007. The only other man to claim an ODI four-for on his birthday is Stuart Broad , with 4 for 44 for England against Australia in Cardiff in 2010. Four men - Vinod Kambli , Sachin Tendulkar , Sanath Jayasuriya and Ross Taylor - have scored one-day international hundreds on their birthdays. Jayasuriya 's , against Bangladesh in Karachi in June 2008 , came on his 39th birthday . Has anyone batted for longer in Tests than Shivnarine Chanderpaul ? asked Kelvin Broadbent from Barbados It 's difficult to be exact about this , as Chanderpaul has quite a few innings for which we do n't know precise batting times. The ones we do have suggest he is close to Jacques Kallis , who lies third on the overall list with around 650 hours at the crease ; Chanderpaul 's known innings ( before the first Test against South Africa in Centurion ) added up to 636 hours , so he has spent around a month taking guard in Tests. Out in front are Sachin Tendulkar ( 688 hours ) and the overall leading crease-occupier , Rahul Dravid ( 735 ) . The ESPNcricinfo database does have details of balls faced for all the leading contenders ( apart from one short innings for Tendulkar and four for Allan Border ) : Dravid faced 31,258 balls in Test cricket , Tendulkar 29,437 ( plus a 92-minute innings in 1990-91 in which he scored 11 ) , Kallis 28,903 , Border 27,002 ( plus four innings that brought him 78 runs ) and Chanderpaul 26,861 so far . How many players who made their debut during the last century are still playing Test cricket ? asked Guru Subramanian from India The recent retirement of Mahela Jayawardene , who played his first Test in August 1997 , has removed another name from this dwindling list. Only two current regular players made their debuts in the 20th century : the seemingly ageless Shivnarine Chanderpaul won his first cap in March 1994 , and the Sri Lankan slow left-armer Rangana Herath in September 1999 ( although it was about a decade before he nailed down a regular place ) . Daniel Vettori made his Test debut early in 1997 , and played in New Zealand 's most recent Test , against Pakistan in Sharjah in November - but that was his first Test for more than two years , and possibly a one-off reappearance. Harbhajan Singh made his Test debut in March 1998 , but has n't played a Test now since March 2013. Younis Khan just misses out : he made his debut ( and scored a century ) in February 2000 .
