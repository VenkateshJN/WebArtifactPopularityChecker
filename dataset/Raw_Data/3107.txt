JP Duminy was also replaced by Rilee Rossouw in the middle order and all-rounder Wayne Parnell , whose bowling was punished by the Indians , by Farhaan Behardien . " We 're going to have a bat first today... Hopefully get some good runs behind us and put the Windies under some pressure , " De Villiers said . West Indies were able to recall Sulieman Benn in place of Nikita Miller after the tall spinner recovered from a back problem . Top order batsman Darren Bravo is still struggling with a hamstring injury that might yet see him sent home from the tournament , however , and Jonathan Carter retains his place in the side . More importantly , though , Chris Gayle was in the side despite a back problem and looking to maintain his form after his record knock of 215 against Zimbabwe on Tuesday . " It 's a good wicket. I 'm also excited to be bowling first , " Holder said .
