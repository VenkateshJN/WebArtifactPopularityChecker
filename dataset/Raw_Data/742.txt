The Mumbai batsman had this to say about his injury : " I am good to go. I had issues with my hamstring , but I was working on it in the last few days with the team 's support staff. I will be playing against Australia tomorrow in the warm up game. It will be my first World Cup experience and I 'm excited. " Bhuvneshwar Kumar too was suffering from an ankle injury that saw him miss out on both the Tests and the ODIs in Australia. But the highest ranked Indian bowler in ODI cricket was spotted bowling in the nets without any obvious discomfort . " I have fully recovered now. Yes there was a niggle in the One days and did n't play the tests too. But now I have recovered. Last 3-4 days were really good for me and I 'm looking forward to playing the World Cup " , said the medium pacer .
