World Cup 2015 : Unscheduled Indian tour hurt Sri Lanka preparations , says official The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Mar 23 , 2015 , 05.37PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 COLOMBO : The hurriedly arranged tour of India by Sri Lankan cricket administrators last year hurt the team 's chances of going beyond the quarterfinal stage of the World Cup , a former SLC co-member has said . In a letter to the SLC Chairman Jayantha Dharmadasa , Shammi Silva says the Indian tour , which Sri Lanka lost 5-0 , upset the fitness program aimed at the 50-over showpiece event . Silva urges the summoning of an emergency executive committee meeting to discuss and call for explanations on Sri Lanka 's early exit . Silva cites selection blunders , selecting players on political influence and the wrong choice of the present national coach as the reason which contributed to Sri Lanka 's exit . Without naming Marvan Atapattu , the current national coach , Silva says Sri Lanka would have been better off with a foreign coach , a view supported by the chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya , Silva claims . He puts down internal fighting among the coaching staff as another reason for Sri Lanka 's poor showing . This was the first time since the 1999 World Cup held in England that Sri Lanka had failed to secure a place among the final-four places . In 2007 and 2011 they were runners up to Australia and India respectively while the Kangaroos beat them in the semifinal of the 2003 World Cup held in South Africa .
