Sohail , 26 , was awoken in the night in the Rydges Latimer Hotel by what he believed was a ghost pushing him . According to report from New Zealand Media and Entertainment ( NZME ) , Sohail woke up in the night scared , insisting there was a supernatural presence in his room. The youngster insisted on shifting to another room and had developed high fever after which the team authorities pressed the hotel management to change his room immediately. According to sources , Sohail has not trained with the team since that incident. " He 's not trained for two days because he 's so traumatized , " the source told NZME. " He 's pretty freaked out. " Interestingly , this seemingly strange incident is not the first of its kind in International cricket. In the England summer of 2014 , fast bowler Stuart Broad complained about a supernatural presence in his room in a hotel in London. Shane Watson , in 2005 , too was reportedly spooked during his stay at the Lumley Castle in Chester-le-Street . Meanwhile , a hotel spokesperson clarified that there was 'no active ghost ' in the hotel. " It 's hard to believe. The Pakistan management told me it was only a nightmare. I spoke with a team physiotherapist and other people in the team. He ( Sohail ) did n't come to me but they wanted him to move rooms. He 's been sleeping in another room for about two nights now " .
