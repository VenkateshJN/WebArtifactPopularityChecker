The 74-year-old was the cynosure at the prize distribution function of a school cricket tournament. He looked fresh and rested after a gruelling election 'campaign ' which saw him outwit seasoned heavyweights to reclaim the BCCI throne. He exchanged pleasantries with CAB officials , who greeted him with bouquets . The huge media contingent threw a barrage of questions at Dalmiya as soon as the prize distribution was over. Dalmiya , however , refused to answer any of those. " I have nothing to say today... Just give me some more time to settle down. I will call all of you sometime next week and brief you about my plans and programmes , " was all that he offered before being escorted off the media zone . In the evening , Dalmiya said in an email communication that his first priority as BCCI chief would be to restore the image of the Board which had suffered a lot during the last few years. He also stressed that the Indian Premier League had to be conducted smoothly . " We 'll have to make certain that the IPL , which will be commencing shortly , is conducted in a proper way , " he stated . The president also wished the Men in Blue all the best in the World Cup. It was learnt that the first working committee meeting of BCCI 's newly-formed office-bearers is likely to be held late March in Kolkata .
