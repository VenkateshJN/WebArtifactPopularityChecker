" As soon as Sunny bhai took over as the IPL ( interim ) chief , he told me , 'remember that IPL 2014 should be remembered for the cricket and nothing else , " Ranjib Biswal , the IPL governing council chairman , said. " To that effect , the players have signed a code of conduct and even team owners have signed it. " Sunil Gavaskar , the court-appointed IPL chief , agreed. " The other thing I stressed on is that the game should be played hard but fair. I spoke to the captains and coaches and made that point. All the players are role models and I reminded them their responsibilities. " Gavaskar also spoke of how he had a chat with all CEOs and owners of the franchises and asked Chief Operating Officer Sundar Raman to write to them asking if there were issues which needed to be addressed. " Every franchise responded. We are being inclusive and not exclusive , " he said . Till now in the UAE , there 's been no controversy and it has come as a relief for BCCI. " The UAE authorities have been superb. They have gone out of their way to ensure that undesirable elements are not anywhere near the ground.
