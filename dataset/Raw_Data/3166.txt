The West Indies , after scraping through the group stage , still believe they can pull off a miracle against New Zealand at the Westpac Stadium in the fourth quarterfinal on Saturday . But apart from the inconsistent run of the Windies , there 's something more that is worrying the team. It 's the sore back of Chris Gayle which kept him away from practice on Thursday. It 's not yet clear whether he will be able to take the field . " We are trying our best to get him fit for Saturday. Let 's see how it goes over the next two days , " a West Indies team official told TOI . Despite these doubts , Darren Sammy insisted that Gayle would play the quarterfinal , come what may . " Chris is not missing this quarterfinal for anybody. He is more pumped up than we are. He 's been writing down the path for us and the different scenarios. We 've had teams who got the better of us and he 's said we 've got a chance of meeting them in the semis when it matters.
