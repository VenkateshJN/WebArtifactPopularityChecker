( AP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 CANBERRA : Chris Gayle bludgeoned his way into the history books by becoming the first player to score a double century in the World Cup as the West Indies rode on his record-equalling 16 sixes to notch up a massive 73-run win via D/L method against Zimbabwe on Tuesday . Scorecard | Pics : Gayle 's knock Gayle , who became the only non-Indian batsman after Sachin Tendulkar , Virender Sehwag and Rohit Sharma to score a double ton , smashed 215 off just 147 balls with the help of a staggering 16 sixes and 10 fours to help West Indies amass 373 for two after electing to bat first . Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 The destructive batsman was also involved in a record 372-run second-wicket partnership with centurion Marlon Samuels ( 133 ) before West Indies bowled out the Africans for 289 in 44.3 overs during their revised chase of 363 in 48 overs post a brief spell of rain . Former South Africa opener Gary Kirsten held the previous individual record with a score of 188 against the same opponents at the 1996 edition in Rawalpindi , while the legendary retired Indian duo of Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid held the partnership record , which they scripted against New Zealand in 1999 . Gayle thus became the only player in world cricket to hit a triple hundred in Tests , double hundred in ODIs and a hundred in Twenty20 internationals . This was Gayle 's first century since June 2013 , the ton coming off 105 balls after the two-time winners opted to bat at the Manuka Oval. He reached his double ton in 138 balls , hitting Tendai Chatara for a boundary . While his first hundred was a workmanlike effort , the second was Gayle at his devastating best , getting there off a mere 33 balls . Such was the onslaught that West Indies smashed the hapless Zimbabwe bowlers for 195 runs in the last 13 overs , 152 of them coming in the final 10 . Gayle fell short of the highest number of sixes by only one , tying it with Rohit and South African captain AB de Villiers . Gayle was ably supported by Samuels , who scored 133 off 156 balls with the help of 11 fours and three sixes . Gayle 's effort was also the highest ever individual score by a West Indian batsman , bettering Vivian Richards ' 189 against England way back in 1984 . The total gave West Indies a perfect platform to post their second win in the tournament and inch closer to a quarterfinal berth , after starting their campaign with a shock defeat against Ireland . Gayle treated the Zimbabwean bowlers with disdain as he recaptured his best form after scoring just 36 and four in his first two knocks at the quadrennial extravaganza . It was the 35-year-old Gayle 's 22nd ton in his 266th ODI for the West Indies . The burly Jamaican , who in the process crossed 9000 runs in this format , was earlier fortunate to have survived a contentious referral for LBW when he was yet to open his account. And then he was also dismissed off a no ball , much to the Zimbabweans ' misery . But before that , Tinashe Panyangara was slammed for 82 runs in nine overs , while Tendai Chatara gave away 74 in 9.4 overs . Gayle also contributed with the ball , picking up a couple of wickets for 35 runs from his 6 overs . Faced with a daunting task , the Zimbabweans were off to a horrendous start losing opener Regis Chakabva ( 2 ) and Hamilton Masakadza ( 5 ) cheaply . Sikandar Raza made 26 while Brendan Taylor scored 37 off 48 balls . But it was Sean Williams who top-scored with a 61-ball 76 while hitting nine boundaries. Craig Ervine contributed 52 off 41 balls , hitting seven fours and a six , before being bowled by Gayle . Zimbabwe were never in the game and were soon at the receiving end of their second loss in as many games .
