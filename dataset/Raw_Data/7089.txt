4.50 ( 1w ) 28.1 to Ballance , third softie of the match ! How frustrating must that feel for England. Picked a length ball , played a massive slog sweep and has picked out the man at deep midwicket to pin-point precision. End of a decent innings , but he would have wanted to push on a lot further considering how he stayed patient early on against good , consistent seam bowling 135/3 28.4 to Morgan , hello hello ! Morgan is out to a full toss ! Looks to be a bit too cute with a lap sweep and the ball shaves off the outside half of the bat to first slip. Now England are just inventing ways to get out 135/4 34.6 to Bopara , right through ! Might be a googly and if it was , he 's playing all around it. Lazy little drive has just enough gap between bat and pad for the ball to sneak through 157/5 Pakistan innings ( target : 251 runs from 50 overs ) R
