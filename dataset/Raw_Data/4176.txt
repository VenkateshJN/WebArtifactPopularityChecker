Root backs Crowe 's call for soccer-like card system The author has posted comments on this article ANI | Jan 20 , 2015 , 06.13PM IST Root has been on the receiving end of Warner 's fiery temper. Page 1 of 4 England batsman Joe Root is in support of New Zealand great Martin Crowe 's call for a football-like card system to curb misbehaviour in cricket on field . Root has been on the receiving end of Australian opener David Warner 's fiery temper. Warner 's growing reputation as a hard-hitting batsman has coincided with his increasing fondness to get involved in on-field spats , making him a regular visitor to the match referee 's room . Warner 's latest spat with India 's Rohit Sharma in Sunday 's tri-series contest , cost him half his match fee and a reprimand from his own board , who have asked the opener to stop looking for trouble , Sport24 reported . Crowe had stated that there is a growing concern that Warner 's thuggish behaviour has gone too far. He added that soon one day , it would lead to an incident that would sully the game for good . Crowe had claimed that one has to take the offenders out of the game for extended periods , adding that two yellow cards should result in a red card , which should ban any player for six months . Root felt Crowe 's suggestion made a lot of sense. He said that at the minute , people are n't happy with the way people are holding themselves on the field and questioned that if that is going to sort it out then why should they not do it . Root , who was famously punched by Warner in a bar in 2013 , said that one is out there to either score runs or take wickets , adding that if that is not a player 's main focus then one is not doing their team a full service. He added that it 's about mutual respect for each other . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
