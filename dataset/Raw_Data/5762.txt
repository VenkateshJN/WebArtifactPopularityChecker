Starc likely to miss start of IPL 2015 Bengaluru , Wed , Apr 01 2015 Last updated on Wednesday , 01 April , 2015 , 06 : 25 AM Australian fast bowler and man of the series in the recently-concluded ICC Cricket World Cup , Mitchell Starc , is likely to miss the start of Indian Premier League ( IPL ) season after suffering a minor injury to his knee. Starc , who was sold to the Royal Challengers Bangalore ( RCB ) in last year 's IPL auction , was advised two weeks of rest making him unavailable for the opening stages of the tournament . " Mitchell ( Starc ) had some knee soreness during the latter stages of the World Cup , " Alex Kountouris , Australian team physio , said , " He will have a short period off to rest and recover , before being reassessed by CA medical staff. We estimate his recovery time will be between two-three weeks. " Starc , who captured 22 wickets at an incredible average of 10.18 in the World Cup , has been widely touted to lead a misfiring RCB bowling attack and help improve the team 's indifferent performances of recent seasons. Starc 's injury compounds RCB 's bowling woes - they 've also had another of their pace bowling acquisitions , Adam Milne , sidelined due to a heel injury suffered during the World Cup. In Starc 's absence , fellow Sydney Sixers seamer Sean Abbott could make his IPL debut . With a hectic cricket season ahead for Australian players that includes tours of West Indies and the all-important away Ashes series in July , Cricket Australia are unlikely to risk rushing their star pacer into action . RCB , led by India Test captain Virat Kohli , will begin their quest for a maiden IPL title with an away game against the defending champions , Kolkata Knight Riders , on March 11 . RCB Squad for IPL 2015 : Virat Kohli , AB de Villers , Chris Gayle , Mitchell Starc , Nic Maddinson , Varun Aaron , Yuzvendra Singh Chahal , Rilee Rossouw , Vijay Zol , Yogesh Takawale , Abu Nechim Ahmed , Harshal Patel , Ashoke Dinda , Sandeep Warrier , Manvinder Bisla , Iqbal Abdullah , Dinesh Karthik , Subramaniam Badrinath , Darren Sammy , Sean Abbott , Adam Milne , David Wiese , Jalaj Saxena , Sarfaraz Naushad Khan , Shishir Bhavane Â© Cricbuzz
