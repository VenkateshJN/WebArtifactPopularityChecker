Delhi Daredevils v Rajasthan Royals , IPL 2015 , Delhi April 11 , 2015 Daredevils strive for winning formula Start time 1600 local ( 1030 GMT ) Play 02 : 04 Agarkar : Big game ahead for Daredevils Big Picture It 's possible one of these teams has not spent on the entire squad as much as the other has on one player. Rajasthan Royals have shallow pockets but still deep resources. Delhi Daredevils have emptied their house season after season only to fail time and again , except during the first two seasons when they reached the semi-final ; in 2008 , they lost to , well , Royals. They have now lost 10 matches in a row , the last one against Chennai Super Kings , who were way off their best both with the bat and especially with the ball . Daredevils should be absolutely filthy with themselves for letting that opportunity go. There might be a core building , though : in Nathan Coulter-Nile , Imran Tahir and Amit Mishra they have an attack that will compete. Mohammed Shami and Zaheer Khan will surely be added to the mix at some point. Royals will have to work hard to score runs against them , but it is the Royals ' bowlers who will look to trip up the Daredevils batting. Tim Southee , Chris Morris , James Faulkner and Pravin Tambe could just as well be an international attack . There is enviable balance and power in the Royals side , but Daredevils will like to think they are not too far off it if only their batting can come together . Watch out for … Yuvraj Singh batted at No. 6 in Daredevils ' unsuccessful chase of 151 against Chennai Super Kings. The innings included a nice cover-drive , a leg glance , and three awkward pulls , the last of which got his wicket. There was expected rust in his batting , but it was argued - reasonably - that he batted too low. While keeping him for the crunch was an obvious show of faith in Yuvraj , he and JP Duminy at No. 7 left the top too inexperienced and the basket of these two left-hand batsmen could n't take the weight of all the eggs. There is merit in having a gun player for the end , but it might not be a bad idea to split the two , and have Yuvraj bat at No. 4 , where he gets some time to build an innings. It will also give the inexperienced top order some confidence . This is a big season for Sanju Samson . Last year he came close to the Indian ODI team , and even travelled to England. MS Dhoni has quit Tests , and is showing signs of decline in limited-overs batting. There are going to be tours this year when Dhoni might rest. While Saha is the heir apparent in Tests , Samson will want to make sure he is the first man called up when Dhoni chooses to rest. And in India , IPL form plays a major role in ODI - sometimes , even Test - selection ; just ask Karn Sharma who made a Test debut based on IPL performances . Stats and trivia Royals lead the head-to-head against Daredevils 8-6 , including wins in their last four meetings , and a 2-2 head-to-head at Feroz Shah Kotla The last time Yuvraj played against Royals , he scored 83 off 38 for Royal Challengers Bangalore , but so batting-friendly was that game that Royals won with seven balls to spare Mishra has got batsmen stumped 16 times in the IPL , which is four more than any other bowler Of the 15 times that a player has scored 40 or more and taken three or more wickets in the same IPL match , six have been by a Royals player Quotes " Last year I did n't really know my role and played only a couple of games. I did n't really get a handle on how to fit into the team. This year , I am glad to have played the first game. We 'll see how things unfold and take it from there.

Pindia on April 12 , 2015 , 9 : 15 GMT Mathews must play all matches and this is why Duminy as captain was a mistake adi133 on April 12 , 2015 , 8 : 53 GMT I do n't see a point in playing your best players at 6 and 7. Yuvi , Mathews , duminy should be batting at 3,4 and 5 if they want to have any impact on the game. Leaving out Tahir would be Delhi 's biggest mistake if they are thinking of that. You need impact players in T20s and Tahir is the one who would win you matches on his own. Mathews should come in for Morkel. With addition of Shami , this Delhi side looks really good . adi133 on April 12 , 2015 , 7 : 54 GMT RR took the overseas players when they were little known , after a few years now , those little known players have become best in the business and are paying off. Hats off to the RR management. They are really a dangerous side now . on April 12 , 2015 , 7 : 43 GMT Delhi needs Mathews , his banning in Chennai was a big blow. Also Yuvraj and Duminy must bat higher. The success of Sri Lanka as a T20 team is because the best batsman bats up front on April 12 , 2015 , 5 : 27 GMT Mathews is sorely needed in this line-up. Could have used his calm and cool approach in the chennai game. Better bet than the huffing and puffing Albie Morkel who took so long to get going. Yuvraj should bat at 3 and Duminy and Mathews at 4 and 5. They should n't mess with 3,4,5 no matter the match situation. Good luck DD on April 12 , 2015 , 3 : 12 GMT My DD 11 : Manoj Tiwary , Shreyas Iyer , Albie Morkel , Yuvraj Singh , Jp Duminy , Angelo Mathews , Kedhar Jadav , C Gautham , Amit Mishra , Coulter Nile , Shami. Cant get gautham out as dekock is in bad form and cant sacrifice other overseas players... Have to find any other player who can keep . on April 12 , 2015 , 1 : 30 GMT with mathews back ... DD Look good ..... XI : Agarwal,De kock,Duminy,Yuvraj,Mathews,K jadhav,Mishra,Shami,Zaheer,Coulternile,Nadeem on April 11 , 2015 , 22 : 26 GMT D.D captain is doing totally dummy things. I think he is needed some time to be a good captain. Speaking about C.M.GAUTAM- he is good for nothing . so replace him with Manoj tiwary or any Indian batsman. Ang keep playing de cock who is one of the best killing instinct with his bat instead of A.morkel. A right formation is required in batting order. Its an IPL .YOU have to play your best players in just 20 limited overs. If you wait for those last overs buddy time & tide waits for none. Eventually results comes in your way . JRP100 on April 11 , 2015 , 21 : 57 GMT DD 11 saurabh tiwary , de kock , mathews , yuvi , jp duminy , manoj , kedar , coulter nile , mishra , shami , zak/nadeem rajasthan 11 rahane , watson , smith , nair , samson , faulkner , binny , hooda , morris , kulkarni , tambe Enough tinkering around with batting line ups , these 2 ( particularly delhi ) need to put their best international class batters closer to the top order to make as many runs as possible. Otherwise the likes of nair , samson , iyer and agarwal get out early and put pressure on the middle order. It works much better this around where the top order set a solid platform for the domestic indian batters to come in later , without so much pressure on them . crrkiran on April 11 , 2015 , 19 : 50 GMT yuvraj vs bravo battle began in 2006. how many of u remember the game India lost by one run in west Indies where yuvraj was cleaned up by bravo. surely last game proved it aditya.continous on April 11 , 2015 , 19 : 46 GMT My message to DD fans would be - Be ready for more agony on a sunday afternoon. If you follow Manchester United , you have a chance at a cheerful evening post the drubbing that RR are going to hand over to DD . aditya.continous on April 11 , 2015 , 19 : 41 GMT DD does n't have the balance. CM Gautam and Mayank Aggarwal are easy meat for any quality bowling attack. Mayank may still last a couple of overs , Gautam does n't belong here. He 's not beyond ranji. And no matter how strong your middle order is ( which is not exactly the case with DD ) , if openers are this weak , you 'll loose more games than win. They have to stuff De Cock in and sacrifice Tahir. And replace Morkel with Angelo. Get Manoj Tiwary in place of Gautam and let Iyer have another go , though iam quite sure he is n't ready for IPL yet . on April 11 , 2015 , 18 : 53 GMT I dun know abt Yuvi to be frank , he doesnt play well at all,esp with bat ! ! he shud be given more confidence to bring more from im an prob play at 4..wid addition of Mathew and M shami they will be real gud side but seriously , Duminy needs to play at 3 or 4 ! Mukul Akolkar on April 11 , 2015 , 18 : 51 GMT More than Yuvraj 's batting position , I feel the bigger worry for DD should be their openers. Agarwal and CM Gautam at the top aare somewhat a gamble , and especially Gautam opening the innings didnt look very convinving at all. It looked more like they wanted to fit in Gautam somehwere and just slotted him at the top. They can even open with Iyer and Agarwal , and keep Gautam out , and bring Mathews and Shami/Zaheer in place of Tahir and Gautam , and play Jadhav as a keeper for Sunday 's game. And if they do want a regular keeper in Gautam , they must play him at 7/8 ( given that Morkel can very well play at 7 ) . Kotla is a small ground with a very good batting track , so the batsmen will take their chances against the spinners and go after them. And Tahir also takes up an overseas spot . D.S.A on April 11 , 2015 , 18 : 49 GMT Now that Mathews will be available , there will be a more obvious line-up for Delhi to now have in their middle and lower order ; 3. J.P Duminy , 4. Y.Singh , 5. A.Mathews , 6. K.Jadhav , 7. S.Tiwary. If Albie is to be included , the Tahir misses out , but I do not think Delhi need Morkel , and he will probably lose his place. The other two internationals for Delhi should be Coulter-Nile and Sandhu as they add variety to the Indian bowlers that they have available , and of course , their own bowling talent . FiGhtCluB_99 on April 11 , 2015 , 18 : 22 GMT Samson is n't even a regular keeper to be considered for selection of a Test keeper. Wonder if he has ever kept wickets in a 4-day/5-day match. Saha , Karthik , N.Ojha and CM.Gautam are the candidates for that spot right now . cnksnk on April 11 , 2015 , 18 : 20 GMT For all the fans sentiment Yuvi was never the greatest player of the short ball. Against CSK even the gentler pace of Bravo troubled him. Expect some short stuff from Morris and Faulkener. However great a player is arms 16 cr is insane and clearly shows the heart ruling the head. Sad that after 8 years Delhi does not seem to have the hang of building a team . on April 11 , 2015 , 18 : 05 GMT Yuvraj needs to come at number 3 … on April 11 , 2015 , 16 : 27 GMT Yuvi needs to bat up the order and openers should play responsibly then it DD who is going to win the more matches 1847 on April 11 , 2015 , 14 : 49 GMT if mathews play..DD will definitely win No featured comments at the moment . 1847 on April 11 , 2015 , 14 : 49 GMT if mathews play..DD will definitely win on April 11 , 2015 , 16 : 27 GMT Yuvi needs to bat up the order and openers should play responsibly then it DD who is going to win the more matches on April 11 , 2015 , 18 : 05 GMT Yuvraj needs to come at number 3 … cnksnk on April 11 , 2015 , 18 : 20 GMT For all the fans sentiment Yuvi was never the greatest player of the short ball.
