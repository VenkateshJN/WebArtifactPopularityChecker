Team India in World Cup semifinals The author has posted comments on this article Kathakali Banerjee , TNN | Mar 24 , 2015 , 05.05PM IST Page 1 of 4 These boys in blue have been there , done that before . Well , not maybe the same bunch of players , but others before them. When India takes the field against Australia on Thursday , it 'll be the sixth time that they will play in the semis . Dhoni 's team is in superb form , winning all the group matches and the quarterfinal against Bangladesh. Of course , we 're hoping they will go the distance . Here 's looking at the five other semifinals India 's been part of. It 's a mixed bag , with two losses and three wins. We hope the victory tally will go up by Thursday . 1983 VS : ZIMBABWE SCORE : India ( 2668 in 60 overs ) ; Zimbabwe ( 235 all out in 57 overs ) KEY PLAYERS : Kapil Dev ( 175 * ) and Madan Lal ( 3 wickets ) VENUE : Nevill Ground , Tunbridge Wells Walking in at 94 , Kapil Dev played a sensation al counter-attacking innings to score 175 , the highest individual score then in a World Cup game , to take India to 2668. A collective effort from the bowlers then saw India home by 31 runs. Pity is , BBC was on strike that day and there is no recording of the mayhem Kapil unleashed. The Indians went on to beat West Indies in the finals to win the World Cup . 1996 VS : SRI LANKA SCORE : Sri Lanka ( 2518 in 50 overs ) ; India ( 1208 in 34.1 overs ) KEY PLAYERS : Aravinda de Silva 66 , Sachin Tendulkar 65 , Sanath Jayasuriya 312 VENUE : Eden Gardens , Kolkata It 's a match that 's etched in the memory of Indian cricketers and fans. Chasing Sri Lanka 's 251 , India had slumped to 120 for 8 by the 35th over , when the crowd began throwing fruits and plastic bottles onto the field. The players left the field for 20 minutes and when they returned , more bottles followed. Fires were also lit in the stands. Match referee Clive Lloyd awarded the match to Sri Lanka , the first default ever in a Test or One Day International . 1987 VS : ENGLAND SCORE : England ( 2546 in 50 overs ) ; India ( 219 in 45.3 ) KEY PLAYERS : Graham Gooch 115 and Mike Gatting 56 * , Mohammad Azharuddin 64 VENUE : Wankhede , Mumbai A fine partnership between Graham Gooch and Mike Gatting deprived India of a place in the finals. India won the toss and put England into bat. At 279 , Gooch and Gatting shared a partnership of 117 runs in 19 overs to post a formidable 254 on the board. India had a shoddy start , losing 3 wickets for 73. Though Mohammed Azharuddin scored 64 off 74 balls , the team was bowled out for 219 in 45.3 overs , giving England a berth in the final . 2011 VS : PAKISTAN SCORE : India ( 260 for 9 in 50 ) ; Pakistan ( 231 all out in 49.5 overs ) KEY PLAYERS : Sachin Tendulkar 85 , Misbah-ul-Haq 56 , Wahab Riaz 546 VENUE : Mohali , Chandigarh No match in world cricket can get more exciting than an India-Pakistan encounter. India won the toss and elected to bat first , but struggled to score fluently , as Wahab Riaz bowled a superb spell to dismiss the top order. Sachin Tendulkar , who struggled to score , was dismissed for 85 , while India finished with a total of 260. The Indian bowlers , however , wrapped up the Pakistan innings for 231 to seal a place in the finals.India went on to lift the World Cup , beating Sri Lanka . 2003 VS : KENYA SCORE : India ( 270 for 4 wickets in 50 ) ; Kenya ( 179 all out in 46.2 ) KEY PLAYERS : Sachin Tendulkar 88 , Sourav Ganguly 111 VENUE : Kingsmead , Durban Kenya 's pinnacle performance surprised all in this edition of the World Cup after they beat three Test-playing nations -Sri Lanka , Bangladesh and Zimbabwe to reach the semifinals. Their dream run was , however , brought to a stop by India. Crisp batting and some clever bowling helped India beat Kenya to reach the finals. Though hopes were high , team India subsequently failed to live up to expectations , losing to Australia in the finals .
