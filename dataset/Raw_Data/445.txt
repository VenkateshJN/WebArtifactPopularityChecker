" ( Dhoni back to lead India in 2nd Test ) " That 's part of the reason Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood have been included in the team.

It has been a promotion that Smith has been looking forward to for a while . " I 've had a chat with a couple of the senior players and the coach about it. I just thought that in taking over the captaincy and a bit of extra responsibility that I would step up to number four and get the job done there. I do n't think there 's a big difference between batting four and five , " said Smith , who is now Australia 's 45th Test captain . Young fast bowler Josh Hazlewood is set to make his debut in a new-look Australian pace attack , which will also include recalled left-arm pacer Mitchell Starc . " I 've watched Josh very closely over the last couple of years at New South Wales and he impresses me every time. I think he 's only getting better and better. This pitch should suit him perfectly , " Smith said . " He 's very skillful for his age and I 'm looking forward to seeing him zing a few through and bowl with that extra bit of pace and get that extra bit of bounce as well. It 's very exciting for Josh to make his debut on Wednesday , " he concluded .
