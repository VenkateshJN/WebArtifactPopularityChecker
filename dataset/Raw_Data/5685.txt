Twitter Reactions : A higher batting average than Inzi , Miandad and Anwar Fri , Mar 20 2015 Last updated on Friday , 20 March , 2015 , 06 : 11 PM Misbah and Afridi said their good-byes to the ODI format © Getty Barely two days after the emotional farewell to Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene , the cricket fraternity rose to salute the Pakistan duo of Misbah-ul-Haq and Shahid Afridi as they bade good-bye to the ODI format following Pakistan 's six-wicket defeat to Australia in the third quarter-final of the 2015 Cricket World Cup . In a career spanning 19 years , Afridi notched up an impressive 8064 runs and 395 wickets from 398 ODIs. With 351 hits over the fence , Afridi topped the charts for hitting the most number of sixes in ODI cricket. He also scored the fastest 100 in an ODI game , off 37 deliveries , a record that stood for more than 17 years before Corey Anderson and then by AB de Villiers got it off 36 and 31 balls respectively. His all-round abilities led Pakistan to the World T20 title in 2009 , and the semi-final of the 2011 World Cup . Misbah was just as effective , if not flamboyant. Blessed with an ice-cool temperament and a shrewd cricketing brain , Misbah was the fulcrum of a constantly under-performing batting order and was often left to bail the side out of tricky situations. Despite making his ODI debut in 2002 , it took Misbah around six seasons to become a team regular. He finished ODIs with 5122 runs at an average of 43.40. Perhaps the one blemish in his record is that he finished without a single century to his name . Current and former cricketers , journalists and cricket aficionados took to Twitter and offered their congratulations to the stalwarts of the modern game . I really enjoyed playing with @ SAfridiOfficial & Misbah Ul Haq they r my captains too so thanks for all the support & guidance as seniors — Mohammad Hafeez ( @ MHafeez22 ) March 20 , 2015 Misbah-ul-Haq leaves one day cricket with a higher batting average than Inzamam-ul-Haq , Mohammad Yousuf , J Miandad & Saeed Anwar # Cricket — Saj Sadiq ( @ Saj_PakPassion ) March 20 , 2015 Congratulations to Misbah Ul Haq and Shahid Afridi for an outstanding one day career . — Saqlain Mushtaq ( @ Saqlain_Mushtaq ) March 20 , 2015 There is little doubt that Afridi held your attention in a match.
