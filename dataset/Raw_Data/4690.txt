World Cup 2015 : Luck of the Irish as Joyce freed on bail The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Feb 25 , 2015 , 02.27PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 BRISBANE ( Australia ) : Ireland 's Ed Joyce had a lucky break as he survived the ball hitting the stumps while batting against the United Arab Emirates in a World Cup clash in Brisbane on Wednesday . Amjad Javed thought he 'd struck with his fourth ball when an inswinger beat left-hander Joyce 's defence and caused the LED lights on the bails to flash . But although the off-bail was disturbed , it landed back in its groove and Joyce , who stood his ground as seamer Javed celebrated prematurely , was not out . Joyce , who was on 16 at the time with Ireland 35 for one in the 11th over , added insult to Javed 's injury by driving the next ball down the ground for four . Ireland were chasing a target of 279 for their second victory in as many Pool B games , having beaten the West Indies , after the UAE scored 278 for nine on the back of Shaiman Anwar 's 106 .
