Australia v England , Group A , World Cup 2015 February 14 , 2015 'A farce to overshadow a farce' ESPNcricinfo staff How Twitter reacted to the controversial dismissal of James Anderson that cost James Taylor his maiden hundred shares 24 James Taylor did not get the dead ball he wanted © AFP In the 42nd over of England 's chase , James Taylor was pinged on the pads by Josh Hazlewood , and an lbw appeal was upheld by umpire Aleem Dar. Taylor , setting off for a leg bye , instantly signalled for a review. Concurrently , Glenn Maxwell had hit the stumps to catch Anderson short of his crease. Replays suggested Dar had raised the finger before the run-out was effected. But Kumar Dharmasena ruled Anderson out , leaving Taylor stranded on 98 and the three Mitchells - Marsh , Starc and Johnson who had claimed nine wickets among themselves -- one short of a perfect ten. The ICC later accepted that it was an error . England robbed. Maybe not of victory , but of a consolation Taylor 100. Crazy umpiring. Still , a dinner reservation is a dinner reservation . — Andy Zaltzman ( @ ZaltzCricket ) February 14 , 2015 Somebody look up the rule. # WC2015 # AUSvENG — Martin Blake ( @ martinj_blake ) February 14 , 2015 That just makes no sense. Absolutely bonkers decision. Fell real bad for @ jamestaylor20 , but how well did he handle it. Proper player . — Iain O'Brien ( @ iainobrien ) February 14 , 2015 Robbed of a century by 2 runs , James Taylor handled that with class and dignity . — Alt Cricket ( @ AltCricket ) February 14 , 2015 Just because he is built like a 12-yr old kid , does n't mean you bully him like this. Dreadful umpiring ! # CWC15 # AUSvENG — Sonali Dhulap ( @ pillya ) February 14 , 2015 Oh good. A nice farce to overshadow a farce. Well done @ jamestaylor20 though ! # CWC — Andrew Miller ( @ miller_cricket ) February 14 , 2015 How soon before # JusticeForTaylor starts trending ? # CWC15
