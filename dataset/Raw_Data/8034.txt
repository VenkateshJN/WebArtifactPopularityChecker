Statement regarding Australia-Bangladesh match in Brisbane Share this article : Extreme weather may affect the Australia-Bangladesh # cwc15 match ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 organisers are working closely with authorities in Queensland regarding tomorrow ’ s match between Australia and Bangladesh given the extreme weather situation in the State and the forecasts for ongoing rain in Brisbane . Our thoughts are with the people affected . However as there is no reserve day for pool matches , we will continue to prepare in the hope that the match can go ahead. The ICC match officials will make a decision on the match tomorrow ( Saturday ) based on conditions at the time . The match can still go ahead with a delayed start if necessary. A match can be successfully completed if each side has minimum of 20 overs which means that it is still possible to achieve a result with a start after the scheduled innings break . Ticket refunds may apply if the match is abandoned without a result and there are fewer than 25 overs bowled in total. This is consistent with Cricket Australia ’ s refund policy. Further details on the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 refund policy can be found at www.cricketworldcup.com . We will continue to monitor the situation and advise of any changes . Share this article :
