Kolkata Knight Riders v Mumbai Indians , IPL 2015 , Kolkata April 7 , 2015 Mumbai brace for dynamic Knight Riders Start time 2000 local ( 1430 GMT ) Play 03 : 38 Agarkar : Narine , Pollard will want to prove a point Big Picture Defending champions v former champions makes for good billing. Being the season opener entices its share of audience. A dash of chequered recent history and both Kolkata Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians have points to prove . A 14-match winning streak for Gautam Gambhir 's men screeched to a halt in the Champions League T20 final. Sunil Narine 's absence - he was suspended for an illegal action - coloured an eight-wicket defeat to Chennai Super Kings. There had been doubts over his participation as late as last Sunday , but the BCCI sub-committee for suspect actions is satisfied with the changes. " It has never been our strategy to have a back-up for Sunil , because there ca n't be a back-up for him , " Gambhir said . Now though they do n't have to worry about plan B. They have most of their A-team to call on , barring the injuries to James Neesham and Chris Lynn. Robin Uthappa was the top-scorer in the Ranji season. Morne Morkel was one of the bowlers of the tournament at the World Cup. Ryan ten Doeschate and Andre Russell have excellent pedigree as T20 finishers. They retain Shakib Al Hasan 's services for the first couple of matches. Options aplenty . Options that should worry Mumbai. Last we saw them , they became the first IPL team to fail the qualifying round into the Champions League T20. But there were extenuating circumstances : Rohit Sharma , their captain , was injured and left their team combination a mess. His presence at the helm , along with Ricky Ponting as coach , and the Lasith Malinga-led bowling raises expectation. Kieron Pollard will have his own spotlight , as well. Since his time away from the West Indies team , he 's written two columns for Al Jazeera and played only twice as many games of competitive cricket. Not the best ratio for an active cricketer. So the biggest question Mumbai will face is if the various cogs fit together smoothly . Form guide Mumbai Indians LWLLW Watch out for … Since the acquisition of Sunil Narine , the Knight Riders ' spinners boast the best average ( 20.86 ) , economy rate ( 6.5 ) and strike-rate ( 19.2 ) in the IPL. A T20 captain 's dream , they rip through the overs , leaving batsmen in a daze and the scoreboard stagnant. A " fresh pitch , " according to Gambhir and evening rains in the lead-up to the opening match can limit the amount of purchase available . So how can Mumbai combat the spin strangle ? That vast thinktank would look to Rohit Sharma to provide an answer. He is arguably their most versatile player and his ability to soak pressure and beat it was on show when he struck a century against Bangladesh in the World Cup quarter-final. He does it with greater frequency in IPL as he showed in the 2013 season when he took over captaincy and won Mumbai their only IPL title . Stats and trivia Mumbai have won 10 out of 14 matches between the two sides so far. Although Knight Riders have come out top in their last two encounters . Knight Riders have never held the purple cap , although they do have a player in the squad who had won it for a different team - Morne Morkel for Delhi Daredevils in 2012 Quotes " I have always maintained that even if he [ Sunil Narine ] bowls a straight ball , it is always going to be an advantage - that 's the kind of aura and that 's the kind of threat he has had on the opposition throughout the last three years " Kolkata Knight Riders captain Gautam Gambhir on his primary match-winner " We have had very good memories of Kolkata. We won the championship there. We understand the conditions there very well. Am sure the guys can exploit the conditions well. " Captain Rohit Sharma on Mumbai Indians starting their campaign in Kolkata Alagappan Muthu is a sub-editor at ESPNcricinfo © ESPN Sports Media Ltd . OLDEST on April 11 , 2015 , 8 : 47 GMT Lets discuss the past records of Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL T20. Chennai Super Kings are 2 times champion of IPL T20. CSK group squad is 3 times runners up of Pepsi Indian Premier League 2014. They have played every one of the 7 seasons of IPL T20.They have come to the last 5 times and they won the title 2 times. Then again Sunrisers Hyderabad did not won the IPL T20 title. They join the IPL T20 in 2013 and have played just 2 IPL. In 2013 they achieve the elimination round stage yet in 2014 they were at sixth position on the focuses table. So we trust will have a decent match CSK versus SRH today in IPL 8 2015. Both the groups are fit for winning the match , they have quality players in their group squads who can turn the match at any phase of amusement . Chennai Super Kings will win match Javiar87 on April 10 , 2015 , 0 : 28 GMT @ WALID RAZA : Dreaming is good as it gives your hopes !

MI can win and have potential , but everyone in their must contribute properly . Nampally on April 8 , 2015 , 13 : 40 GMT SRH has batting stars like Dhawan , Warner , Ion Morgan , Williamson , Bopara backed up with bowlers of the calibre of Steyn , Starc , B.Kumar , P.Kumar,Leg spinner Shama , Ishant + local talent like Milind , Suman , Teja , Ashish Reddy. It will be a struggle to choose the XI which has optimal 4 foreign players. Even the local talent has matured to perform well in T20 format with Suman dominating Mushtaq Ali T20 tourney. These individuals need to ply as a " team " as they have done in the past. If they do it is tough team to beat ! Good Luck , SRH . adi133 on April 8 , 2015 , 13 : 25 GMT Whether narine is the same bowler he used to be or not will decide if KKR is going to win this or not . Nampally on April 8 , 2015 , 13 : 17 GMT There is too much emphasis placed on KKR & MI teams while ignoring teams like Rajasthan Royals , SRH & CSK. Even Punjab Kings can easily upset MI & KKR. So forget the past & stay in the present. I think KKR & MI will be hard pushed to make the play off. The other 4 teams mentioned above have better chance to make it. SRH has a power house in batting & Bowling. I back them to make it to the last 4 along with CSK & Punjab Royals. The 4th spot will be hotly contested by the rest of the teams.

Like every sports , some teams may be strong and some may be weak in cricket. Lot of feelings/passion of a nation are related with a team. A fan of cricket can not call a team as a 'FUNNY ' one . on April 8 , 2015 , 10 : 39 GMT Well ! Finally Wait is over & IPL Season 8 is begining just about in 2 hours. So we are ready My Fav KKR ( Kolkata Knight Riders ) just because i am huge fan of Shah Rukh Khan , Suddenly KKR on the charge they have some decent players , more importantly Sunil Narine will be back in the action , we got Shakib & Payush Chawla to support Narine , on the surface of Kolkata Spinners might have a big game. I am Pakistani , and there is no Pakistani player in IPL that is sad news , but i love to watch Cricket any way. So KKR will Rock..... Insha Allah on April 8 , 2015 , 10 : 27 GMT its fascinating to see sunil narine bowling in today 's match. I hope that his bowling would be as effective as he was . ashishlovecricket on April 8 , 2015 , 9 : 24 GMT My playing 11 for MI would be : 1. parthiv ( bat/wk ) 2. unmukt ( bat ) 3.rayudu ( bat ) 4.rohit ( bat ) 5.pollard ( all rounder ) 6. correy ( all rounder ) 7.tare ( bat ) 8.harbhajan ( spinner ) 9.malinga ( fast ) 10. bumrah ( fast ) 11.de lange ( fast ) Siva_Bala75 on April 8 , 2015 , 8 : 26 GMT To me , this IPL is all about Tier 2 Indian players. The current Indian players ( all formats ) are Tier 1 , for me Tier 2 are those that have played for India and have fallen out for some reason or other. This is a long list- about 25-30 of them- Yuvraj , Gambhir , Dinesh Karthik , Ojha , Aaron , Manoj Tewari , etc. The expectations on them are quite high- as high as Tier 1 while the tolerance towards them is low- not the same as Tier 3 or those young players knocking the doors. Many of them are at cross roads- Make or Break season for many of these Tier 2 guys. Best wishes to all ! on April 8 , 2015 , 8 : 00 GMT KKR 2015 is a team of allrounders. Their stregth is bowling but they lack specialist batsman in the middle order which may be an issue. If they are chasing 170 + , this could be a major problem if the top three batters do n't fire. Surprised by the strange combination this time . imtiazjaleel on April 8 , 2015 , 7 : 47 GMT KKR 's bowling is highly depends on Sunil Narine if he performs then it will be difficult to beat them. Of late Morne Morkel & Umesh Yadav is also in good form so i think they have good chance . cricketdebator on April 8 , 2015 , 7 : 36 GMT Am afraid Narine will lose his effectiveness as a bowler. Naturally , from now onwards , he will be mindful that he is under scrutiny , and tremendous pressure to produce with his remodelled action. Knowing that , batsmen might also take advantage and approach him differently , thereby increasing the pressure. The real test for Narine will be how he withstands this pressure , but historically , bowlers are hardly the same after having to change or remodel their action. For cricket 's sake , let 's hope Narine beats the odds . SamWintson92 on April 8 , 2015 , 7 : 16 GMT @ CricInfo , please do put your likely XI in the preview like international matches. I always look forward to. My Teams : KKR XI : 1 Gambhir ( C ) 2 Uthappa ( WK ) 3 M Pandey 4 Y Pathan 5 Suryakumar 6 Russell 7 Shakib 8 Chawla 9 M Morkel 10 Narine 11 Umesh. MI XI : 1 Rohit ( C ) 2 L Simmons 3 Chand 4 C Anderson 5 Pollard 6 Rayudu 7 Tare ( WK ) 8 Harbhajan 9 Vinay 10 Gopal 11 Malinga . jo_n on April 8 , 2015 , 6 : 41 GMT Without narine KKR wont be in top 4. KKR is reliant on Narine to win matches. Sehwag is the only player scored freely and consistently against Narine so far . jack17482 on April 8 , 2015 , 6 : 32 GMT let d festival begins.....finally cricket is back to INDIA....45 days of carnival will begin tonight... We all surprised by selection of KC Cariappa ( only for price given ) ...KKR should go with him and Morny Morkel , Narine , Sakib-ul Hussan and Russel/Ryan ten as foreigners. For Mumbai Indians...Malinga , Pollard , Finch and simmons/Anderson/de lange should be in the squad as foreigners. Between Simmons and Anderson , if Parthiv is playing then Opening slot will be finch and Parthiv and we can go with Anderson for his all-rounder facet and hard hitting in mid-order. myKKR--- Uthappa , Guti , Yusuf , Manish , Morkel , Surya , Ryan ten/ Russel , Narine , Sakib , Umesh , Cariappa/Kulddep/Piyush. myMI---Finch , Parthiv/Simmons , Malinga , Pollard , Blizzard , de Lange , Bhajji , Ojha , Rayudu , Rohit , Vinay. ENJOY...................d game...we drink....eat and live..... . Mukul Akolkar on April 8 , 2015 , 5 : 33 GMT KKR ( on paper at least ) appears possibly the weakest batting lineup this IPL. Apart from a sheet anchor to steady the extremely fragile middle order in case of a collapse , they also lack the 'X-Factor ' batsman like Maxwell , DeVilliers , or Pollard in their lineup. Yusuf Pathan is very inconsistent , and Andre Russell is just a pinch hitter. All their X-Factor players seem to be in their bowling , Narine being the numero uno , and Morkel , Hogg , Shakib and the newcomer Cariappa. A seasoned campaigner like Jayawardene or Sangakkara ( KKR bowlers also deserve a better keeper than the part-timer Uthappa ) could have walked straight into this lineup , even in place of one of the overseas allrounders. Not to say that their vast experience would have helped the team. Sangakkara was in destructive form this World Cup , Jayawardene also got a ton among other good knocks. They also had a chance to rope them in , to replace their overseas players. But instead they chose Azhar Mahmood , which seems really baffling. He is n't much of either a batsman or a bowler and I do n't understand what KKR saw in him. The team might face the consequences of having such overconfidence on the bowling alone and neglecting the batting. On another note , I do feel very good for Cariappa. He is barely 20 , and can bowl both offbreaks and legbreaks. And straightaway , he finds himself with someone like Brad Hogg and Sunil Narine , which could really benefit his bowling. He looks to be a great future prospect for India , and if he succeeds , he has the talent to create history . on April 8 , 2015 , 5 : 07 GMT It should be very interesting to see Sunil Narine , will he be as effective he was before ? ? Sunil Narine 's form & effectiveness is directly proportional to KKR 's form ! on April 8 , 2015 , 4 : 42 GMT for KKR 3 yadav should play Umesh Kuldeep and Suryakumar on April 8 , 2015 , 4 : 24 GMT To all those saying simmons should be an automatic choice and even though I agree whole heartedly to it , I doubt whether ponting is on the same wavelength as us , because for all I know he might start the IPL with finch/blizzard before going back to simmons . Tho if he does apply this logic with malinga and pollard , I will be more than happy. Anderson and mcclenaghan ( left arm fast/medium ) might add a better balance so hopefully Parthiv , Finch , Chand , Rohit , Anderson , Simmons , Rayudu , Bhajji , Vinay , Mitch , Ojha but likely 11 Parthiv , Finch , Chand , Rohit , Anderson , Rayudu , Pollard , Bhajji , Vinay , Malinga , Ojha on April 8 , 2015 , 4 : 07 GMT KKK MY XI 1gautam 2uthappa 3manish 4s yadav 5yusuf 6u yadav 7karippa 8sakib 9sunil 10russsal 11cummins on April 8 , 2015 , 1 : 25 GMT I do wish the players in this 8th IPL great success and enjoy every moments of play and bonding with each other. Although it is only 45 days , but the fond memories one takes back is great. Hopefully IPL will carry on for years to come. Syabas to the organizers and also the handy man in all the stadiums and the best of all , the CHERR Leaders. Super . MumbaiIndiansOfficialOffice on April 7 , 2015 , 23 : 36 GMT Our Probable Playin XI is Going To be : 1.Aaron Finch , 2.Parthiv Patel , 3.Rohit Sharma ( C ) , 4. Ambati Rayudu , 5.Corey Anderson , 6.Kieron Pollard , 7.Unmukt Chand , 8.Harbhajan Singh , 9.Lasith Malinga , 10.Vinay Kumar , 11.Pragyan Ojha Replacements : Jaspreet Bhumrah , Aditya Tare , Lendl Simmons , Mitchell McGlenghan As Long As There Are No Injuries, MIOFFICIAL Siva_Bala75 on April 7 , 2015 , 22 : 21 GMT KKR has so many spinners- 7 of them. Narine , Chawla , Shakib , Botha , Hogg , Kuldeep and Cariappa and couple of part time spin options : Yusuf and Surya . usernames on April 7 , 2015 , 22 : 19 GMT For MI : Chand , Finch , Rohit , Rayudu , Anderson , Pollard , Parthiv ( floater ) , Harb , Malinga , Vinay , Ojha BRUTALANALYST on April 7 , 2015 , 22 : 12 GMT Simmons was Mumbais big player last year and has to play. Corey and Polly may have performed in only 1 or 2 games Corey just 1 with bat but at time it mattered however if he is going to miss end of tournament they should stick with side they can keep throughout so Simmons Finch Pollard and Malinga would be my choice of overseas unless they want to use another bowler like Hazlewood instead of Finch who has never really set IPL alight despite the big buck he receives . Subhajit111 on April 7 , 2015 , 20 : 18 GMT KKR XI-1.Gambhir , 2.Uthappa , 3.Pandey , 4.Yusuf , 5.Shakib , 6.Ten doeschate , 7.Suryakumar , 8.Cariappa , 9.Narine , 10.Yadav , 11Morkel Mumbai XI-1.Finch , 2.Parthiv , 3.Rohhit , 4.Rayudu , 5.Anderson , 6.Pollard , 7.Chand , 8.Harbhajan , 9.Malinga , 10.Vinay Kumar , 11.Ojha nili on April 7 , 2015 , 18 : 22 GMT Tough to choose the winner tomorrow.
