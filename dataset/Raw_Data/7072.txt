0 ( 1w ) 2.5 to Coetzer , 152.4 kph , gone ! This time it was just back of a length and close enough to off stump for the leaden-footed Coetzer to edge rather than miss as he aimed a massive back-foot punch , looking to go through the covers. Flies to Smith at shoulder height , and he takes it easily 8/1 6.6 to MacLeod , 150.6 kph , ouch. That was short , with a little bit of width on it , and MacLeod has played the cut fairly well , but this one he pops into the air , and straight into the hands of backward point 36/2 25.2 to Davey , 145.7 kph , clatter. Off-stump yorker , and Davey is late bringing his bat down. It actually straightened a touch and went past the outside edge 130/9 25.4 to Wardlaw , 143.8 kph , boom , and that off stump takes another beating. It 's full and fast and Wardlaw gave himself room to play through the off side , bat was nowhere near it in the end. Again it straightened off the pitch 130/10
