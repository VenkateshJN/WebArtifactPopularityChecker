As per the latest Test ranking charts released by the ICC , India are placed seventh with 93 points - a notch below Sri Lanka , who are now in sixth place with 96 points. New Zealand are in fifth place with 99 points while South Africa lead the table with 124 points . World Cup champions Australia are second with 119 points while England and Pakistan are going neck and neck at 104 and 103 points respectively . Similarly , after India 's 0-2 loss against Australia in the four Test series , no Indian batsman has found place in the top-10 Test rankings despite skipper Virat Kohli 's four centuries in the series . In fact , there are n't any bowlers also in the top-10 while Ravichandran Ashwin is the only saving grace with his third rank in the allrounder 's list after Shakib Al Hasan and Vernon Philander .
