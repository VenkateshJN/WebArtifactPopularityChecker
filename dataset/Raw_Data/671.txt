ICC World Cup : Wonder What Pakistan Learnt from a Dry Contest Like UAE.. . ICC World Cup : Wonder What Pakistan Learnt from a Dry Contest Like UAE.. . After stuttering starts in World Cup 2015 , Pakistan have finally managed to lift spirits somewhat after wins against Zimbabwe and UAE. Can these triumphs assure the team of a place in the quarters ? Only time will reveal Pakistan 's fate in the tournament .

Â© Getty Images It was a contest between a movable object and a stoppable force as Pakistan took on UAE at the quiet seaside town of Napier in New Zealand yesterday. The crowd for a World Cup match , first ( of three ) at Napier in this edition of the tournament , drew such poor crowd that at one point there were more media personnel and volunteers than the fans in the stands. ( Scorecard | Points Table ) Pakistan have stuttered and sputtered in this tournament , a lot of their problems arising out of a fragile top order. UAE have tried gamely , but they were always going to be a push over against established cricketing powers. Even a side story of two former Pakistani compatriots and now opposing head coaches - Aaqib Javed and Waqar Younis - could bring life in to this sedate affair.

Nasir Jamshed was inexplicably included in Pakistan 's World Cup squad as injury replacement , and an even more confounding matter is that he has been persisted while falling with the pull shot repeatedly without much to show for. Not to mention , he is n't exactly Jonty Rhodes in the field. Yesterday , he fell again to a poorly executed pull shot and was gone for 4. ( Captain Misbah proud of two wins ) UAE had the opening but they dropped Ahmed Shehzad a couple of times and by the time the second Pakistani wicket fell , the game was as good as over. The rest of the Pakistani batsmen filled their boots up while UAE 's hard-trying-but-limited-in-skill bowlers kept watching balls disappear over the boundary.

As Pakistan rolled easily to their first 300 total of the tournament - 339-6 all said and done - the only question in the minds of the people watching would have been : How quickly can Pakistan wrap up UAE ? As it turned out , 129 runs. Shaiman Anwar helped himself to another 50 and Amjad Javed provided some late-hitting entertainment but it was all headed only one way. Besides Jamshed 's obvious lack of form , it is not quite sure what Pakistan can learn from this game and utilise against their next opponent South Africa who are coming off their own mauling of another Associate nation .
