Shreyas Gopal pins hopes on batsmen to turn it around The author has posted comments on this article Sunil Subbaiah , TNN | Mar 18 , 2015 , 08.43PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 BENGALURU : Karnataka 's leg-spinning all-rounder Shreyas Gopal said the dropped catches of Kedar Jadhav and Rishi Dhawan helped Rest of India seize the initiative on the second day of their Irani Cup encounter. However , the youngster felt the home team was better equipped to finish on a high . " The two catches we missed were crucial , " said Gopal , who finished the day with a three-wicket haul. " The two lapses probably allowed Rest to get at least 50 runs more. But for the two dropped catches , I think we fielded brilliantly , " he added . Having conceded a 20-run first innings lead , Gopal said Karnataka would look to pile up as many runs as possible in the next four sessions. " We are a batting-oriented side and we have already gone past the deficit. The plan will be to bat for one and half days and get at least 300 by the end of day three , " said Gopal , who scored 663 runs during Karnataka 's successful Ranji Trophy campaign . " I am sure towards the end of the fourth day the wicket will become slower and make batting a trifle difficult , " said the youngster , who picked up 28 wickets this season . Meanwhile , Rest of India 's Kedar Jadhav , who missed out on a ton by 22 runs , said the team was not satisfied with their first innings total of 264 . " We are not satisfied with the 20-run lead we managed , " Jadhav said. " We would have liked a lead of at least 50 to 100 runs. We know we have to bat fourth on this wicket , which will make batting more difficult , " the diminutive batsman added .
