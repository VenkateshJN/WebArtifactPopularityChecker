The Group B clash will eclipse the 988 million who watched the two neighbouring nations clash in their 2011 World Cup semi-final at Mohali on March 30 , 'The Australian ' newspaper reported . It said that the match has been sold out for six months. " It will be unlike any cricket match ever seen in Australia , " an unnamed World Cup official was quoted as saying by the newspaper .

Bookmakers Centrebet has Australia at a seemingly short $ 3.50 , followed by South Africa at $ 5 , India and New Zealand both at $ 7 and England at $ 12 .
