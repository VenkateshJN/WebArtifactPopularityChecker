Taylor points out 'mental flaws ' after defeat Sun , Mar 01 2015 Last updated on Sunday , 01 March , 2015 , 04 : 48 PM Taylor top-scored for Zimbabwe with 50. © AFP Former captain Brendan Taylor has blamed the Zimbabwe batsmen for the 20-run defeat against Pakistan in the ICC World Cup in Brisbane on Sunday. Chasing a modest 236 to win at the Gabba , the African team had fifty-run stands for the third and fourth wickets but also lost wickets at important stages to let go of what could have been their second win in four matches . " We found ways to get out at crucial periods , some soft dismissals as well. That 's being a major downfall for us in the last four games , " Taylor , who top-scored for his team with 50 , told reporters after the match . " Crucial periods , when batters have needed to get through those initial periods and finding ways to get out. It 's not helping the team 's cause. " For Pakistan , fast bowlers Mohammad Irfan and Wahab Riaz took four wickets each to fashion the win. Their efforts were duly acknowledged by Zimbabwe 's best batsman in recent years. " We felt that half the job was done particularly well restricting them [ Pakistan ] to 235 , " Taylor said. " They came out in the first 15 overs and made it pretty difficult for us and bowled some heavy balls and it was difficult to score . " It needed a partnership and unfortunately 50s or 30-run partnerships wo n't get you over the line. So it 's extremely difficult to comprehend this loss . " Some experienced players are not kicking on and should be taking a bit more responsibility. I think there are a few mental flaws as individual players that are costing us at crucial periods. " Zimbabwe next play Ireland in Hobart on March 7 . © Cricbuzz ( with inputs from agencies ) Tags
