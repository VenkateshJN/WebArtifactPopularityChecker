The 669-ball partnership between Kane Williamson and BJ Watling in Wellington brought to mind some other memorable long stands shares 14 The firm : VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid 's 376-run stand altered the course of the Test and the series © AFP McCullum and Watling Less than a year before , also in Wellington , BJ Watling had shared another record-breaking stand for the sixth wicket with Brendon McCullum , who completed New Zealand 's maiden Test triple-century. They put on 352 to save the game against India , breaking the record for the highest sixth-wicket stand in Tests by one run. That partnership was even longer than the recent one against Sri Lanka , weighing in at 738 balls. A plaque to mark this feat was unveiled at the Basin Reserve before the recent match , in which Watling helped break his own record . May and Cowdrey Another famous rearguard , at Edgbaston in 1957 , saw Peter May and Colin Cowdrey add 411 in 500 minutes , a Test fourth-wicket record at the time. This was the famous occasion when the England batsmen used their pads more than their bats to negate the varied spin of West Indies ' Sonny Ramadhin , who had taken 7 for 49 in the first innings : in this second effort he toiled through a record 98 overs , and shouted himself hoarse appealing for lbws. Many felt he was never the same bowler again. Because Ramadhin and his fellow spinner Alf Valentine did most of the bowling , although the stand lasted 500 minutes ( well down the all-time list ) a total of 191 overs were bowled , or 1146 balls , probably the longest by that yardstick in Test history. However , the Melbourne statistician Charles Davis suspects that Glenn Turner and Terry Jarvis batted for one over longer in their opening stand of 387 for New Zealand against West Indies in Georgetown in 1971-72 . Jayasuriya and Mahanama Then the biggest - and also the longest. In a record-breaking batsmen 's match in Colombo in 1997 , Sanath Jayasuriya ( 340 ) and Roshan Mahanama ( 225 ) shared a second-wicket stand of 576 - more than 100 higher than any other Test partnership at the time - against the toiling Indian bowlers on a Premadasa shirtfront : Sri Lanka 's eventual total of 952 for 6 was also a record. The two stayed together for 753 minutes , and faced 1110 balls . Sobers and Worrell A couple of years after they had fielded through the May/Cowdrey padathon , Garry Sobers and Frank Worrell paid England back in Bridgetown with a huge stand of their own , batting for more than two full days ( although weather chipped a few overs off the first of those ) . Sobers made 226 while Worrell remained undefeated on 197 : they added 399 for the fourth wicket in 579 minutes , and around 160 overs . Best friends hunt in pairs : Sangakkara and Jayawardene 's 624-run stand is also a first-class record © AFP Bailey and Watson Not quite as long as some of these stands , but more famous than most : Willie Watson and Trevor Bailey saved the match - and probably the Ashes - with a long rearguard at Lord 's in 1953. They came together early on the final day with England 73 for 4 , chasing an unlikely 343. A longish tail ( Johnny Wardle was at No. 9 ) meant that a quick wicket would probably be fatal - but Bailey produced the barn-door defence that became his trademark , and the stylish Watson buckled down too. They put on 163 before Watson finally fell , and when Bailey was out for 71 in 257 minutes there were only 35 minutes left for the others to survive. At one point during their stand , Watson asked his partner whether they should go for the win : Bailey turned his back and stomped back to the other end . Laxman and Dravid Few partnerships have had the effect of the fifth-wicket alliance between VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid against Australia in Kolkata in 2000-01. India were still behind in the follow-on when the two came together , but they would not be moved for more than a day - 104.1 overs or 625 balls - and added 376. Laxman 's eventual 281 was the greatest of his several virtuoso performances against Australia - who have been chary of enforcing follow-ons ever since. India grabbed the momentum in stunning style , and took the series by winning the next Test too . Sangakkara and Jayawardene Another Sri Lankan run-fest , and another world record : Mahela Jayawardene ( 374 ) and Kumar Sangakkara ( 287 ) put on 624 against South Africa at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo in 2006 , after coming together at 14 for 2. Their third-wicket alliance , a record for all first-class cricket , lasted 157 overs and a touch more than 11 hours. The two close friends eventually shared 19 century stands in Tests . Atherton and Russell England looked done for on the final morning in Johannesburg in 1995-96 when , chasing 479 , they dipped to 232 for 5. But England 's captain Mike Atherton dug deep , and was joined by the doggedly defiant Jack Russell. Together they kept out an attack spearheaded by Allan Donald and containing the young Shaun Pollock , and were still together when time ran out. Atherton batted for 643 minutes in all - his 185 not out was his highest Test score - and Russell for 274 , in which time he scored 29 not out . There 's something about Wellington : the Basin Reserve has witnessed mammoth stands of 467 , 365 and 352 © Getty Images Crowe and Jones Despite the sterling efforts of BJ Watling and friends , New Zealand 's highest Test partnership remains the 467 that Martin Crowe and Andrew Jones shared for the third wicket against Sri Lanka in Wellington in 1990-91. It came in the second innings , after their side had conceded a lead of 323 , lasted for 547 minutes - and 924 balls , the fifth-longest on record. The match was left drawn when Crowe , after more than ten hours at the crease , was agonisingly out for 299 to the friendly bowling of his opposite number , Arjuna Ranatunga .
