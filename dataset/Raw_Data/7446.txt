3 ( 1w ) 6.1 to Smith , 96.6 kph , full , Smith goes for a reverse paddle sweep , misses and is given out lbw ! South Africa desperately needed that. Went for something extravagant first ball , made a mistake and was caught in front of off stump. But it looks as if Smith did glove it onto his pad 78/1 10.5 to Gayle , 87.0 kph , well outside off , Gayle tries to reverse sweep it and gets a little glove to the keeper ! Tahir charges off in celebration and a fabulous innings comes to an end. Cute is n't Gayle 's game , he tried to really take the micky out of Tahir and got a little glove on the reverse sweep that was well held by the keeper in the fingertips 114/2 16.4 to Samuels , 83.3 kph , down the wicket , playing with bat and pad together and it comes off the pad via the bat and loops to cover point. Ca n't say as I 've seen a bat-pad catch to a fielder that far out before. Tried to kick it away but the ball ran off the outside of the pad and then the splice of the bat and looped into the infield. Tahir celebrates like he 's won the world cup 154/4
