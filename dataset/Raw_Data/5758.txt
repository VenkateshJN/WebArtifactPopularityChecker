Richard Burton drank , John Travolta danced , Mao Zedong dictated and Daniel Vettori ... well , Daniel Vettori endured . From the time he surprised many - including his parents and , according to his father , even himself - by becoming New Zealand 's youngest Test debutant at 18 , Vettori has plugged away manfully in a tough sport. He has remained himself , understated , almost monotonous. From a country where spinners never tasted the success that fast bowlers did , and where slow-bowling role models were scant , Vettori not only honed his craft diligently , he became New Zealand 's most successful spinner in Tests and ODIs. He is New Zealand 's leading ODI wicket-taker and the most-capped player in Tests and ODIs. The best left-arm spinner to ever play the game . He overcame injury and criticism many times. He out-bowled fitter , sturdier fast bowlers. He scored runs down the order , at times batted better than specialists up the order. He bailed New Zealand out of trouble countless times. He shouldered the responsibility of carrying the bowling and captaining. He did it quietly , without fuss. He endured . When he made his Test debut at the Basin Reserve in February 1997 , soon after his 18th birthday , his parents Renzo and Robyn were worried whether he would last. So did others watching.Bespectacled , thin and with shoulder-length hair , Vettori ambled up to the crease. He was gangly , awkward , raw. But he was composed , a trait that veteran journalists in the country still remember from that chilly day and credit as Vettori 's hallmark. He has endured . " Robyn and I just wanted him to enjoy it and be reasonably successful , stay in the team for a reasonably long time as supposed to having a boy wonder. I guess there was that perception of 'who 's this young guy ? Is he going to last ? ' and he has , " Renzo Vettori told me earlier during the tournament proudly. And there has been much to be proud of for he and his wife . The 2015 World Cup was always going to be his last assignment. The end was expected , nobody was surprised. He had worked hard on his creaking body over the past year to make himself fit for this World Cup , the first to be played in New Zealand for 23 years. His father remarked how Vettori , at 36 , felt the fittest he had been in years after that period of strengthening himself for the tournament . Right through the World Cup , Vettori has been spoken of in high regards. Brendon McCullum stressed on the powerful impact Vettori has had in the tournament. Trent Boult credited his senior partner for helping ease the pressure on him. Corey Anderson termed Vettori 's wickets in game one against Sri Lanka as " massive " . MS Dhoni , ahead of the final , singled out Vettori 's overs as critical at the MCG . Until he was savaged by Chris Gayle during West Indies ' chase at Westpac Stadium during the quarter-final , Vettori had been mesmerising with the ball , weaving a web around opposition batsmen. His tournament haul during the league stage was 13 wickets from six matches at an average of 13.69 , strike-rate of 25.5 and , most importantly , economy of 3.21 . Pace dominated spin by a big margin in the World Cup , but Vettori showed during the first half that he and his art could still have a key role to play , particularly in the middle overs. In the tournament opener in Christchurch , he played a big role in pegging back Sri Lanka 's chase with the wickets of Tillakaratne Dilshan and Mahela Jayawardene during a fine outing of 2 for 34 , his best in six ODIs. Against Scotland , he snared 3 for 24 in 8.2 overs , helping bowl them out for 142. Just before Tim Southee went mad over England in Wellington , it was Vettori 's removal of Eoin Morgan for a laborious 17 that prompted McCullum to bring back his strike bowler . In that nail-biter at Eden Park , notorious for its short boundaries , it was Vettori who put the skids on Australia 's innings by dismissing Shane Watson and Steven Smith before Boult 's demolition. Afghanistan were no match for the master , who moved past 300 ODI wickets in Napier with 4 for 18. Out of a Bangladesh total of 288 , Vettori was the most economical bowler with 10-0-42-1. He had played a big role in New Zealand 's unbeaten run to enter the quarter-finals . Alas , his record during the knockouts was nowhere near as good. Three matches , two wickets , average 64.50 , strike-rate 61.50 and economy 6.29. Against West Indies , his opening over went for 21 with Gayle swatting three consecutive sixes. His second cost 17. He grabbed two wickets to limit the damage , ending with 2 for 58 from 6.3 overs. In the semi-final , he went wicketless for 46 runs in nine overs , a fine holding role considering South Africa made 281 in 43 overs. In his final match , he bowled five overs for 25 runs , no wicket. Australia 's batsmen played him out , and the last column was blank . He finished the tournament with 15 wickets at 20.46 apiece , the form spinner , and was promptly named in the ICC Team of the Tournament. After his final innings , he received a venomous mouthful from Mitchell Johnson which was totally uncalled for. Did Vettori say anything in reply ? No. He walked off. When he bowled , there was no response to the Australian batsmen. He just bowled . After defeat on Sunday , McCullum said that nobody in the team would announce their retirement yet so as to not steal the limelight from the Australians. True to that word , Vettori waited for two days until he landed in Auckland . Understated when he entered , understated when he left. That 's Daniel Vettori for you . © Cricbuzz
