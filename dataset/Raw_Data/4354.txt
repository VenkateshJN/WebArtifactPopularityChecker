( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 NEW DELHI : Taking a cue from the tragic incident involving Phil Hughes in Australia , the Times NIE Cremica Cricket Cup for Schools in Delhi and NCR , which is due to start this month , has made helmets compulsory for all participants . This was announced by the Times Group organizing committee during the trophy unveiling ceremony here in the Capital on Monday . Former Indian cricketer Chetan Chauhan , who unveiled the Cup in front of distinguished guests , endorsed the rule and hailed Times Group 's efforts to revive school cricket . According to Chauhan , school cricket had always been the stepping stone for cricketers but in recent years club cricket has taken over . " It 's a very positive step taken by the Times group to re-introduce school cricket in a big way. For me , school cricket was my first step. Our cricket association ( Delhi and District Cricket Association ) initiated a tournament for school cricket with 60 teams , but it was reduced to 30 teams later. Hope this tournament will do a world of good to school cricket , " Chauhan said . Over 100 teams from various schools in Delhi and NCR will battle it out on a league-cum-knockout basis. All the matches will follow DDCA rules and be officiated by DDCA umpires . The winners will walk away with trophies , medals and cash prizes worth Rs 1.5 lakh along with other prizes. International umpire Anil Chaudhary also attended the function and took part in the draw . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
