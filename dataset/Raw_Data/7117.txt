They have great potential in T20 matches... . on February 16 , 2015 , 3 : 19 GMT Where is Sakib al Hasan ? ? ? on February 16 , 2015 , 2 : 31 GMT I do n't see Afghan cricket players name , y is that ? on February 16 , 2015 , 2 : 02 GMT Why no Nepalese players ? ? ? Nepal have T20I status though . on February 16 , 2015 , 0 : 30 GMT Hoping yuvraj Singh will be retained by RCB Mr.CricketJKNotHussey on February 15 , 2015 , 23 : 05 GMT KXIP have a solid batting unit , perhaps one reserve keeper/batsman would be good , so they could look for a cheap option. They do need to improve their bowling though. Getting rid of Balaji was a good move and they should try to pick up Siddharth Kaul. He bowls with Sandeep Sharma in Ranji and they both have a good partnership. He is also quite a cheap buy. Axar and Shivam/Karanveer did a great job with the spinning duties , so Bangar could choose to give them more opportunities , although KXIP could try and make a move for someone like Mishra or Ojha. The player KXIp should go all out for is Trent Boult. He has been in amazing form and is hitting his peak right now. Johnson had an indifferent season last time and is quite injury prone. Plus , if he has another bad season , we have no cover for him. Boult would be a great backup or rotation player and could team up well with Sandeep. Another option could be Mitchell McClenaghan. He is expensive but a proven wicket taker . on February 15 , 2015 , 20 : 48 GMT We like IPL and want to see pak players as well , so please select them as well , almost in whole country of Pakistan watching IPL . Aftab syed Brisbane Australia on February 15 , 2015 , 20 : 01 GMT Raj Qalandari.... I think Azhar Mehmood is from Pakistan ? ? ? ? RAJEEVOO7 on February 15 , 2015 , 19 : 39 GMT KKR should go for Indian middle order batsmen like Yuvraj Singh ,Paras Dogra..They need a wicketkeeper in reserve or in need , they should go for Luke Ronchi... Williamson and Boult must be in taken into consideration ..if they choose williamson ,they are going to have option of resting Tendo and bringing Russell up in the batting order..Shakib , Narine,Russell /Morkel , Tendo/Lynn/ ( Williamson ) .. best combination for all types of wickets.. choosing Yuvraj will give them a kind of Substitute for Kallis .He can bat at No. 4 followed by yusuf,shakib ,tendo,s.yadav..if they choose Williamson batting order will be perfect .Williamson batting at No.3 followed by Pandey ,yusuf ,Shakib,Russell,S. Yadav in the increasing order of batting no. Manpreet junjeja should be kept as backup . . on February 15 , 2015 , 18 : 52 GMT No pakistani player why ? SamRoy on February 15 , 2015 , 18 : 25 GMT RCB can buy Manpreet Juneja and Jalaj Saxena. Juneja is a class bat and I am a huge fan of his and Jalaj Saxena will be quite good as No. 7 bowling all-rounder. His off-spinners are far better than Yusuf Pathan and he has a decent batting technique . on February 15 , 2015 , 18 : 20 GMT IPL could have include some afghan players too , in this Auction. it will help their cricket infrastructure and prepared them for big matches against full members , Its sad that IPL is looking down on afghans and judging them , even IPL Management are aware that afghanistan got some big match winners player and are good in t20s on February 15 , 2015 , 18 : 20 GMT No pak players in there.. . on February 15 , 2015 , 18 : 08 GMT IPL why do n't give chance to Afghanistan player ? on February 15 , 2015 , 18 : 07 GMT Well once more no Pakistani Players .
