15th January 1988 Dream debut for Narendra Hirwani Narendra Hirwani , India leg spinner , rounded off a remarkable debut Test against West Indies at the at MA Chidambaram Stadium in 1988. He was only nineteen years old and did not have any international experience , but that hardly showed as the youngster bamboozled West Indies en route to a remarkable match haul of 16/136 , surpassing Australian Bob Massie 's figures of 16/137 on debut. It was a formidable West Indian batting line-up , with the likes of Haynes , Richards and Hooper , among others. However , none of them had any answers against the leggie as he spun a web around the West Indian batsmen to take 8/61 in the first innings and 8/75 in the second to to bowl India to a 255-run win .
