England must improve 'fast ' - Peter Moores February 15 , 2015 READ ALL Posted by ModernUmpiresPlz at February 17 , 2015 Moores did n't understand that the reason his opening combination of Ali and Bell could go after it was because they found stability if one of them went early in Taylor. By moving Taylor wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy down the order for no reason , and then picking Ballance , again for no reason , he basically pulled out the carpet from his own team. Anyone who 's watched English cricket for the last 12-24 months knows that Taylor is the real find for England in recent history. Instead of putting faith in him he trusted Ballance. I must assume Ballance is a very English Englishman with proper English batting for proper Englishment to sip warm lager to and nod approvingly , because every time I 've seen Ballance he 's looked woeful to me , I 'll admit that 's more or less only in Australia. Apparently Moores thinks anyone can play # 3 , it 's 6 that 's a real tough spot . Posted by cricuscrazy at February 16 , 2015 I think Moen Ali should be moved down the order.He is a stroke player but is also a suspect against the short ball.He may make a quick 20 but not sure if that is enough.Chris Jordan will be a good addition.His all around skills will come i handy .
