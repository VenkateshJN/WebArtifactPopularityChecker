Needing 192 for victory in 17 overs , Punjab came out all guns blazing scoring 162-6 before the game ended in a draw.Opener Anmolpreet Singh stayed unbeaten on 55. Leftarm-spinner Sidak Singh was the most successful Mumbai bowler , taking 2-34 . Mumbai coach Vinod Raghavan was a relieved man after the tense finish and credited the entire team for the triumph. " The boys held their nerve and did n't panic when they were under pressure , " he told TOI on Monday evening . " With nothing to lose after conceding the first innings lead , Punjab came back strongly with spinner Sukhwinder Singh bowling really well. But , in the end we won and that 's what matters , " he added . Batsmen Sarfaraz Khan , Jay Bista and Aarman Jaffer came in for special praise from the coach , as did leftarm spinner Sidak Singh for their consistency during the nine-match journey. " I feel Sidak is really coming come up well as he took 30 wickets in just five matches.
