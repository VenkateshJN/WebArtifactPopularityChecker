( Getty Images ) Page 1 of 4 MELBOURNE : A day after expressing his displeasure at Australia 's on-field banter , India vice-captain Virat Kohli on Monday once again had a go at Mitchell Johnson and apparently said something to the home team 's pace spearhead as he was walking off after being dismissed here . The incident transpired in the 68th over of Australia 's second innings when Johnson was dismissed by Mohammed Shami following which Kohli was seen speaking to the batsman . In return Johnson also had something to say but it was not clear whether his talk was directed at Kohli or was a complaint to the umpires as the two on-field officials did have a word with the Indian after that . The hosts put themselves in a comfortable position by taking an overall lead of 326 runs by the end of fourth day 's play as the third Test headed for an exciting finish . Never the one to shy away from an on-field showdown , the feisty Kohli had yesterday said that being called a " spoilt brat " by the Australians brought the best out of him as he smashed a career-best 169-run knock . " It was going on throughout the day. They were calling me a spoilt brat and I said 'maybe that 's the way I am. You guys hate me and I like that'. I do n't mind having a chat on the field and it worked in my favour I guess , " a combative Kohli had said at the end of third day 's play .
