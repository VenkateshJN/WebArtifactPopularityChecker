Fans were chanting my name , it was cool : Guptill The author has posted comments on this article Dwaipayan Datta , TNN | Mar 22 , 2015 , 10.28AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 WELLINGTON : The landmarks in New Zealand cricket hardly get the publicity they deserve. Before Saturday , Martin Guptill held the Kiwi record for the highest score ( 189 ) in an ODI , but not too many talked about it. His 237 at the Westpac Stadium , though , has shifted the spotlight on the right-hander . There were quite a few moments to cherish for the opener , but he feels it was Chris Gayle 's appreciation of his effort that made it all the more special. " Chris came up to me and said , 'Welcome to the league'. That was quite a moment for me , " Guptill said , soaking in the adulation after his hurricane knock . It was Gayle 's World Cup record that he had smashed and talking about the moment when he reached the double , Guptill said : " The fans were all chanting my name and that felt pretty cool. It was even more special because it came on a stage like the quarterfinals of the World Cup. " Guptill has worked closely with Martin Crowe over the last few months and it has reflected in his batting so far in the World Cup. " He has told me to play a lot straighter early on and to cut down shots square of the wicket till I am settled in , " Guptill added . Talking about his ton , Guptill said , " It has n't really sunk in yet and we 've still got a bit of work to do in this tournament so I ca n't dwell on it too much.
