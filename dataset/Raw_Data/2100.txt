Page 1 of 4 NEW DELHI : The BCCI has moved Supreme Court seeking permission to examine MS Dhoni 's deposition before the Mudgal Committee that is investigating the Indian Premier League betting and fixing scandal . The BCCI wants to monitor the audio recordings of the Indian skipper , N Srinivasan , who has stepped aside as board chief and IPL COO Sundar Raman. The apex court has listed the matter for Friday . Senior advocate Harish Salve , who has been representing Aditya Verma of the Cricket Association of Bihar ( CAB ) , had earlier accused the Chennai Super Kings captain of lying about the role of Srinivasan 's son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan in betting and match-fixing scandal during the last edition of the cash-rich league . " Dhoni lied about Gurunath Meiyappan role ; there was no need for Dhoni to lie and it is important to have independent probe into the IPL irregularities , " Salve had earlier said after the Supreme Court ordered sweeping changes in BCCI 's administration . The Indian board , however , has defended Dhoni saying that he has done no wrong and is innocent . The Supreme Court ordered Srinivasan to step aside as BCCI president , while installing Sunil Gavaskar as working president but only for the duration of IPL 7 . For issues related to the BCCI , the SC appointed Shivlal Yadav as the board president . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
