TOI takes a look : Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 AHMEDABAD ( 2011 ) : Australia 260-6 lost to India 261-5 in 47.4 overs . STRENGTHEN MIDDLE-ORDER : After Australia set the hosts 261 to chase on a flat Motera track in the 2011 World Cup quarterfinal , the Indians began losing their way in the middle after a steady start. It was Yuvraj Singh ( 57 * ) and Suresh Raina ( 34 * ) who comfortably completed the chase after the likes of Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni gave away their wickets cheaply . ADELAIDE ( 2012 ) : Australia 269-8 lost to India 270-6 in 43.3 overs . SOUND START : A good start sets the tone for a comfortable chase. With 270 to achieve at the bouncy Adelaide , Gautam Gambhir ( 92 ) added 50 for the first wicket with Delhi dasher Virender Sehwag ( 20 ) and another 50 with Rohit Sharma ( 33 ) for the third to pave the way for a four-wicket triumph . JAIPUR ( 2013 ) : Australia 359-5 lost to India 362-1 in 43.3 overs by 9 wickets . TOP-ORDER , THE NEW FINISHERS : When the top-order can finish off a job , why leave it for others ? This is how the likes of Rohit Sharma ( 141 * ) , Shikhar Dhawan ( 95 ) and Virat Kohli ( 100 * ) reacted when they had to chase a massive 360 runs against an Australian attack comprising Mitchell Johnson , James Faulkner and Clint McKay . NAGPUR ( 2013 ) : Australia 350-6 lost to India 351-4 in 49.3 overs . TIGHTEN LINE & LENGTH : Even though Shikhar Dhawan ( 100 ) and Virat Kohli ( 115 ) helped India get another 350-plus total , the bowlers made their task arduous by bowling too many boundary balls. George Bailey ( 156 ) and Shane Watson ( 102 ) amde merry as fours and sixes came in good numbers - the hosts conceded 39 fours and nine sixes , making fielders virtually redundant . BENGALURU ( 2013 ) : India 383-6 beat Australia 326 by 57 runs . BEWARE OF THE LATE CHARGE : With Australians being characteristically strong in batting , even late-order pinch-hitters can spoil India 's party. This became evident when they almost chased down a 384-run target in Bengaluru with James Faulkner ( 116 ) and Shane Watson ( 49 ) threatening to take the game away from the hosts , who had left the Aussies reeling at 74-4. It was Ravindra Jadeja 's ( 3-73 ) timely scalps which ensured that Rohit Sharma 's ( 209 ) maiden double hundred did n't go in vain .
