1 88.46 9.6 tossed up delivery outside off , gets down on one knee and a slog sweep to deep midwicket , Lalor places underneath it near the ropes to grab that , throws it in the air as he realises of stepping over the ropes. He did n't even managed to throw it neatly as he ends up skipping in the air and plucks it over the boundary line and then manages to get inside the rope with a sideway jump. Third umpire took various angles to check before judging that out. This is scintillating. 84/2 c sub ( CJ Green ) b Lalor 4
