OLDEST joseyesu on January 21 , 2015 , 11 : 54 GMT Nervous Zak , Confident Martyn and explosive Ponting and first over sachin dismissial of Mcgrath. Team Aus was such a dominated side during that time on January 20 , 2015 , 2 : 41 GMT It was downhill after that 15 run first over from Zak 's. Ponting was at the peak of his batting powers. Australia decimated us . on January 19 , 2015 , 19 : 57 GMT @ Big_Poppa_94 , None wants India to be unnecessary aggressive while their competence is much below than the opponents. That 's exactly happened in 2003 final. Earlier India had been thrashed by Australia in such a way that garland of shoes had been put on Ganguli 's photo in Kolkata and Tendulkar 's effigy had been burnt in Mumbai. So there must be enough professional respect to the opposition who thrashed you. We want Indian fast bowler bowl 150 kmph and hit and bloody the opponent batsmen -- not scream like a mouse and stare like a pussy cat after delivering a 125 kmph nonsense.. The act itself would talk sufficiently. Marshal , Holding , Ambrose never sledged Australians. Still they ( Australian players were much rough and racist in 80 's & 90 's ) became mice in front them , because of their skill and power with ball . on January 19 , 2015 , 19 : 03 GMT It was at Wanderers , what do you expect. Any decent batsman will score big on such a batting paradise.. Though it was the finals , if you have a such a team with full of match winners , any good batsman would achieve this on Wanderers ! Wanderers seems to be even flatter than some of the Indian batting pitches : ) on January 19 , 2015 , 16 : 42 GMT A great innings by a great player on January 19 , 2015 , 16 : 31 GMT Every batsman has a day in the game of cricket and that was Ricky 's day who really bated splendidly well with fully utilizing his talent. He took the game away from India single-handedly. India applied every possible tactic to control his flow of runs but could n't. That was Ponting at his best . feral on January 19 , 2015 , 13 : 24 GMT Remember this match very well. I was among one of the hundreds who had got together in the Dundee university 's cafeteria for this match. We were confident that if Ponting could manage such a score , our greats Sehwag and Tendulkar would surely do the same. Unfortunately , SRT tried to slog GM and got out at the very start , while Sehwag continued without any support from the other end. Sad end to a fantastic tournament for India . Imthihal on January 19 , 2015 , 12 : 38 GMT I remember that day , I was with my girl friend in a Market , That time she was more important then the Final Match of Worldcup for me. I saw the match Jahir was Bowling r when i saw the score card the illusion to me was 15 runs for 5 overs , I was happy suddenly some one told me no its not 5 overs its just 5 balls , the illusion was .5 I guess , I was shocked , It would have better if my illusion was true. still that wa n't sad for me you can why ? hehehehe on January 19 , 2015 , 10 : 10 GMT what can a captain do if your frontline bowler starts with wides and conceding 15 in the first over...and one of the main bowlers ( Srinath ) going for 86 in 10 overs...that was too many 12 years back...and no doubt the target was stiff but SA chased down 438 on that very ground... Sehwag proved it too with an attacking 82...but with no support from others , especially the so-called greatest batsman getting out in the very 1st over.... but after the start we got it was a big ahievement to get to the finals , marshalled brilliantly by Ganguly but we literally did n't have any answer to Ponting 's masterclass... Worthy to win any final on January 19 , 2015 , 9 : 42 GMT At that time my 10th class ( ssc ) exams.Still i remember zaheerkhan started with wide.Wonder full captaincy from Gangully.but badluck joseyesu on January 21 , 2015 , 11 : 54 GMT Nervous Zak , Confident Martyn and explosive Ponting and first over sachin dismissial of Mcgrath.

In a league match Aussies had bundled out Indians cheaply and hunted down the target that India had put up ( alike 99 final ) so bat first could have been riskier and our bowlers were in good form untill the final.. infact the Indian bowling attack themselves had bundled out teams cheaply.. ( SL , NZ etc.. ) .. ganguly would have wanted to put his best ammunition ( bowling ) forward & first may be.. nothing could have stopped Aussies that day. We batted long though and should have made a calculated assault on the target something like the 438 game that happened on the same ground .. though I am happy we made amends in a similar situation in the 2011 WC final.. hunting down the target even after losing the openers cheaply.. but 267 odd is nothing compared to 350 something in a world cup final ! ! Big_Poppa_94 on January 19 , 2015 , 8 : 43 GMT Putting Aus to bat was a big mistake. If you win the toss , you should normally bat first and put scorecard pressure. Pretty sure no one had chased over 250 in a final . Big_Poppa_94 on January 19 , 2015 , 8 : 25 GMT TRUTHFINDER : Over aggressiveness ? lol it 's funny how no one is pleased. Sometimes India are criticized of being timid and other times criticized for being too aggressive. Please make up your mind as to what you want from India . on January 19 , 2015 , 8 : 18 GMT I remember this day...I was priviledged enough to be at the Game at the Wanderers , JHB South Africa ! ! ! Was an amazing Game ! ! ! Naresh28 on January 19 , 2015 , 8 : 18 GMT Yah Oz really pummelled India that day. India had played well throughtout the tournament. For us Indian fans it was a great disappointment in the final.We just did not have any good bowling and lost it then . on January 19 , 2015 , 8 : 08 GMT India surrendered during the match. Even AUS scored much , India began with SRT first over pull-shot attempt and wicket to Glenn McGrath. And even they won the toss , put AUS to bat first. Huge blunder ! ! ! dunger.bob on January 19 , 2015 , 7 : 34 GMT I 'll never forget it. Ponting at his absolute best. As usual though , the completely sublime innings of Damien Martyn gets over-looked. .. You can talk about your superstars of today but THAT , my friends , was one powerful cricket team and would more than hold it 's own against anything that 's come along since. I truck no dissent on that . on January 19 , 2015 , 7 : 32 GMT In 121 balls , ABD will score 400 himself today . on January 19 , 2015 , 7 : 17 GMT Inspite of the rsult,Ganguly was one of the finest captains India had and has played a pivoting role in making India world beaters,also his test record especially abroad best for any indian captain,controversary with Chappeel ruined his carrer though TauseefRaja on January 19 , 2015 , 6 : 58 GMT It was just an awesome knock by ponting ! truthfinder on January 19 , 2015 , 6 : 11 GMT The approach of India towards that match was absolutely disgusting. The over aggressiveness of the like Zaheer , Sreenath , Nehra towards the best batting stalwarts against fast blowing like Gilchrist , Heyden , Ponting , Martin was absolutely laughable. Indian captain Ganguli , did not control his team despite knowing the actual weight-age of his own team. I think most of the true Indian cricket lovers appreciated India 's lost because of their arrogant and idiotic attitude in that match. The arrogance was the result of an Indian win against a worthless Pakistan pace attack ( their two legends bowled for the last time at 130 kmph and Shoaib was worst in his control ) and legendary sloppy Pak fielding. Rightly that match was the beginning of the end of Saurabh Ganguli .
