Graphs So , that 's it from this game. We have enjoyed your company and we hope that you will join us for the final Test as well. Mark your calendars as the final Test at the Basin Reserve kicks off on Saturday. Until then , take care. Ciao ! Chasing 105 to win , the Kiwi openers fell cheaply , but Williamson and Taylor stayed calm and saw their team through with 8 wickets in hand. With this , New Zealand go 1-0 up in the 2-match Test series . Throughout the Test , the Southee-Boult partnership troubled the Lankans and today , it was Southee who sent back Kaushal and took the key wicket of Mathews soon after. The 59-run last wicket partnership between Lakmal and Eranga propelled the lead over 100 . But , the Sri Lankan openers showed the spirit to fight and at the end of day 2 , they were 84/0 in the second innings. However , Southee started off day 3 with the wicket of Silva in his first over. Sanga also perished soon after , but partnership between Karunaratne and Thirimanne steadied the ship before the latter departed. Meanwhile , Karunaratne registered his maiden Test ton and was supported well by Mathews , who also got to his fifty. However , late strikes from Boult on day 3 meant that Sri Lankans ended the day with 5 wickets down , trailing by 10 runs . When Sri Lanka came out to bat , they looked rattled with the swing that was on offer. At one stage , they were reeling at 15/3 and ended with just 138 , with the New Zealand catching being exceptional throughout that innings. New Zealand then enforced the follow-on to make matters worse for the visitors . So , New Zealand end the year on a high. In the first innings , New Zealand were 88/3 at one stage when Ross Taylor departed. After that Brendon McCullum came to the crease and ever since he stepped out , Sri Lanka were chasing the game. His belligerent 134-ball 195 took the game away from the visitors and New Zealand posted 441 on the board . Brendon McCullum is also the Man of the Match for his 134-ball 195 Brendon McCullum : 'A really good performance , fifth Test win of the year and it has been great. Our seamers were outstanding. We developed some nice partnerships in the top and middle order and that 's what helped us to post a big total ( when asked about his knock ) . Our pacers have won us many games now and they keep running in and keep getting the job done. Really proud of the guys and a great end to 2014. They wanted to bowl. They were emphatic about bowling again ( when asked about enforcing the follow-on ) . Credit to Sri Lanka about how disciplined they were in the second innings. I am happy where I am right now. In the past few months , I have tried to improve my weaknesses and it 's been good so far ( on his current form ) . The attitude that every game could be your last helps and everyone has been standing up. We are going in the right direction as a group and hopefully , we will keep doing well.' Angelo Mathews : 'It was a very poor batting performance from the whole team in the first innings. The way Karuna ( Dimuth Karunaratne ) batted , it showed a lot of character and to get it against a quality attack here at Christchurch is commendable. We are looking forward to the next Test. It is always hard to come back when a batsman comes out and nearly gets a double hundred in a session ( when asked about McCullum 's knock ) .' Time for the presentation ceremony It has been a great win for the hosts. They have continued their good form and this is the fifth Test win for the Black Caps in 2014 , the most Test wins in a calendar year for the Kiwis . Taylor and Williamson shake hands.

Now , it is upto the batsmen to give New Zealand a 1-0 lead. It should n't be a difficult chase , but stranger things have happened in cricket. Join us in a short while for New Zealand 's chase . However , the Black Caps will definitely be happy that they can now go out and chase 105. Southee bowled an inspired spell and took the first three wickets of the morning. The key moment today was the Mathews wicket as he fell after adding 13 runs to his overnight score. His wicket meant that New Zealand were looking at bundling the Lankans out for a cheap lead. But , the resistance from Lakmal and Eranga made the Kiwis stay on the field for a little longer than they wanted . So , the Sri Lankan innings has ended and if it was not for the last wicket partnership , New Zealand would have chased a total below 50. Both Lakmal and Eranga played their shots and constructed a 59-run stand to propel the lead past 100 . 153.6 Boult to Lakmal , out Caught by Southee ! ! Finally , New Zealand get the final wicket.

Let 's see whether they can achieve that or not . Hello and welcome to day 4 of the first Test between New Zealand and Sri Lanka. For the Lankans , it will be a big task to save this game , considering that they are already five wickets down and there are still two days left in the game. New Zealand 's gameplan will be to attack the Sri Lankan batsmen and bowl them out without giving away many runs. Can Mathews and Co. save this Test match ? Or will the Kiwis quickly knock them over ? We will find out in a few minutes from now. Stay tuned . Currently , Sri Lanka trail by 10 runs and have five wickets in hand. The responsibility of saving this Test match now rest on the shoulders of Mathews , who is currently at the crease on 53. He looked in good touch yesterday , but it is a new day today. Apart from the assistance available for the seamers , there was some turn and bounce on offer for Craig as well . Sri Lanka batted really well yesterday after losing Silva and Sanga early in the first session. The star of the show was Karunaratne , who registered his maiden Test ton and went on to score 152. He was well supported by Thirimanne and Mathews at the other end. But late in the day , Trent Boult removed Karunratne and Dickwella in quick succession and provided New Zealand with an opening to go for the kill and take a 1-0 lead . Sri Lanka 's chance of saving the game lies with their captain Mathews , who has looked very comfortable at the crease. However , it remains to be seen whether the lower order can survive the Kiwi attack tomorrow. If they can , we are in for a great day four. Join us tomorrow to find out whether Sri Lanka can challenge the Black Caps or whether New Zealand run away with the game. Until then , take care . Dickwella , who came in after Karunaratne got out , could hardly put up a fight and perished for just 4. For New Zealand , it was hard work all day long , but they will be happy with the fact that they took 2 wickets towards the fag end of the day. Boult , who was struggling at one point , produced an inspired spell to send both Karunaratne and Dickwella back . Stumps , Day 3 : Sri Lanka have come within touching distance of the New Zealand lead and end the day on 293/5 , trailing by just 10 runs. Karunaratne was the pick of the batsmen as he notched up his maiden hundred and then went on to go past 150. He was well supported first by Thirimanne and then by Mathews. However , his wicket before the end of day 's play has again given the advantage to New Zealand . 124.6 Boult to Kaushal , FOUR , poor delivery to end the day , it was a low full toss outside off and Kaushal drives it through the cover region and collects four Last ball of the day coming up 124.5 Boult to Kaushal , no run , comes round the wicket and bowls a back of a length delivery outside off , Kaushal knocks it past the point fielder and was looking for a single , Mathews was n't interested though and he has to go back 124.4 Boult to Kaushal , no run , on a length and outside off , Kaushal blocks it to point off the outside half of the bat 124.3 Boult to Kaushal , no run , fullish delivery outside off , Kaushal taps it towards gully off the front foot 124.2 Boult to Kaushal , no run , bumper from Boult this time , Kaushal sways away from the line and lets it go 124.1 Boult to Kaushal , no run , length delivery outside off , Kaushal comes forward and defends Last over of the day coming up 123.6 Southee to Kaushal , 1 run , bunts this length delivery towards mid-off , the batsmen take a single before the bowler runs across and stops the ball 123.5 Southee to Kaushal , no run , outswinger outside off , Kaushal was feeling for the ball , but ca n't connect 123.4 Southee to Kaushal , no run , back of a length delivery that shapes away outside off , Kaushal pokes at it , the ball goes past the edge again 123.3 Southee to Mathews , 1 run , straighter in line this time , Mathews works it away to fine leg and gets to the other end 123.2 Southee to Mathews , no run , shapes away from a length outside off , Mathews lets it go 123.1 Southee to Mathews , no run , a loud appeal for lbw , but the inside edge saves Mathews , it was on off and was coming in with the angle , Mathews gets an inside edge onto the pad and that 's what saved him , he would have been a goner had he missed that 122.6 Boult to Kaushal , no run , down the leg side this time , Kaushal ca n't put it away and the keeper collects 122.5 Boult to Kaushal , no run , length delivery around off , Kaushal blocks 122.4 Boult to Kaushal , no run , length delivery angled away outside off , Kaushal looks to drive but misses as the ball goes past the outside edge T Kaushal , right handed bat , comes to the crease With just 2.3 overs to go in the day , Sri Lanka have sent in a night watchman 122.3 Boult to Dickwella , out Caught by Neesham ! !

Southee will open the bowling on day 3. It is quite windy out there as well . It rained last night at the Hagley Oval , but at least for now , the rain has decided to stay away. Even though it is overcast out there , play is expected to start right on time. It should be an interesting contest between the bat and the ball. The Kiwi bowlers will look to make the most of these cloudy conditions and for that they need to pitch the ball in the right areas. Day 's play starts in a short while. Stay tuned . After getting out cheaply in the first innings , the Lankan openers made amends the second time around. Currently , Sri Lanka are 84/0 , still trailing by a big margin of 219 runs. Today , the Lankan plan will be to bat sensibly in order to reduce the lead without losing many wickets. The Black Caps pacers were not upto the mark in Sri Lanka 's second innings , but it is a new day today and they will look to replicate how they bowled Sri Lanka out the first time around . Hello and welcome to day 3 of the first Test between New Zealand and Sri Lanka. New Zealand are currently in pole position as Sri Lanka got bowled out for a paltry 138 in their first innings. New Zealand then enforced the follow-on , becoming only the third team after West Indies and South Africa to do so in 2014 . Tomorrow , the Sri Lankan plan will be to wipe out the deficit and then build a lead from there on. On the other hand , New Zealand 's pacers would come back fresh tomorrow morning and will look to make inroads into the the Lankan batting lineup. Join us tomorrow to find out whether the Lankans can turn it around or not. Until then , take care. See you tomorrow . However , do n't count the Black Caps out. They did take the 10 wickets in the first innings. With three full days to go , there is a lot of time left in the game as well. The Sri Lankan openers may have defied the likes of Boult and Southee the second time around , but Sri Lanka still trail by 219 runs . Stumps , Day 2 : Sri Lankan openers have batted really well after New Zealand enforced the follow on. Both of them have made a good start and will look to convert these starts into big scores tomorrow. For New Zealand , the bowlers that turned up for the second Sri Lankan innings looked quite different from the ones that bowled Sri Lanka out for 138. In the second innings , they were not consistent with their line and length. They ended up bowling way too many short deliveries and their plan did n't seem to work as the Sri Lankan batsmen largely looked untroubled with the short stuff . 34.6 Brendon McCullum to Kaushal

Hello and welcome to day 2 of the first Test between New Zealand and Sri Lanka. Yesterday , we witnessed a brilliant knock from Brendon McCullum , who powered his way to a magnificent 134-ball 195. He was especially severe on the debutant , Tharindu Kaushal. Kaushal did get the wicket of Brendon McCullum at the end , but he gave away 159 runs in his 22 overs at an economy rate of 7.2 as well . After the drubbing they received from the hands of Brendon McCullum , the Sri Lankan bowlers took a few wickets towards the end of the day 's play , managing to pull things back a little. But , the advantage is still with New Zealand considering that they made 429/7 , scoring at 5.33 runs per over. Even though there was some assistance available from the pitch , the Lankans bowlers got mauled all over the place by McCullum and Neesham . Sri Lanka will look to take the final three wickets quickly tomorrow morning whereas New Zealand would want to pile on as many runs as possible. It is going to be a fascinating day with both teams looking to exert their dominance in the first Test. Join us tomorrow to find out whether the Black Caps run away with the game or whether the Lankan Lions can make a rousing comeback. Until then , take care . McCullum was well supported by Neesham , who also looked quite threatening and scored a good 80-ball 85. The Lankans have pulled the game back to a little extent after taking a few quick wickets towards the end , but New Zealand will definitely be rejoicing about their score for now. In the last session alone , they managed 214 runs off just 32.3 overs . Stumps , Day 1 : New Zealand must be delighted with how they have gone past 400 on the first day of the Test match and that too on a greentop. Brendon McCullum was the chief architect of this onslaught for the Black Caps. He was belligerent in his batting display , bettering his own record of the fastest Test ton by a Black Caps batsman. On his way to a blistering 195 off 134 balls , he thrashed the Lankan bowlers at will and ended up with 18 fours and 11 sixes. When he was at the crease , it looked as if he was playing T20 cricket in whites . 80.3 Mathews to Watling , out Lbw ! ! Watling perishes in the last over of the day. It was a fullish delivery that shapes back in from outside off , Watling was looking to defend and missed it completely , he was struck in line with middle and leg , the umpire gave it out and Watling did n't review it. Replays show that had he reviewed it , he would have stayed not out as the ball was going down leg. Anyway , his wicket also means that it is Stumps on day 1.

McCullum has registered a successive fastest ton by a New Zealand batsman ( 74 balls ) , beating his previous fastest Test ton against Pakistan at Sharjah. At Sharjah , he scored his hundred off 78 balls and went on to score a double hundred. Can he convert this into another double ton ? We will find out in this session . With McCullum doing all the hitting , Williamson was happy to sit back and play second fiddle to McCullum. He went on to score yet another fifty , but perished soon after.

Join us in a short while to find out whether McCullum continues with his rampage or whether the Lankan Lions strike back. Stay tuned . Tea , Day 1 : McCullum has taken the game away from the Lankans.

This is the first time Hagley Oval is hosting a Test match , becoming the eight Test venue in New Zealand. It is also the first international game in Christchurch after the devastating earthquake in 2011. Will both the teams opt for an all-pace attack here ? We will find out soon. Toss and teams coming up in a short while. Stay tuned . The focus now shifts to the Test arena. The Black Caps will look to continue their good run in Tests as they have not lost any of their last five Test series. New Zealand will also be boosted by the the return of Trent Boult , Tim Southee and Brendon McCullum , who were rested in the T20s and ODIs against Pakistan. Sri Lanka will miss the services of Mahela Jayawardene , who retired from Tests in October. The Lankans will also be hampered by the absence of Rangana Herath , who has been ruled out with a hamstring problem . Hello and welcome to day 1 of the Boxing Day Test between New Zealand and Sri Lanka at Christchurch. Both Sri Lanka and New Zealand come to this Test series on the back of some good team performances , having won their last ODI series. Sri Lanka comprehensively defeated England 5-2 in the 7-match ODI series. On the other hand , New Zealand came back from behind twice and won the ODI series against Pakistan 3-2 in UAE . Preview : New Zealand and Sri Lanka begin their final tune-up to the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 in conditions vastly similar to the ones they will be facing in the World Cup. But before that , there are two Test matches to be played , the first beginning a day after Christmas day in Christchurch. The city last hosted a Test in the 2006-07 season and had n't seen international cricket since the city was hit by an earthquake in 2011 . New Zealand : New Zealand have had a fascinating 15-months or so in international cricket. Test series wins against West Indies ( home and away ) and India ( home ) followed by draws against Bangladesh and Pakistan. They begin their final preparations for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 at home , buoyed by their recent success in the middle-east. New Zealand 's pace bowling combination of Trent Boult and Tim Southee were successful in setting up Test matches even in the flattest of bowling surfaces in UAE and after getting a much deserved break , they would be expected to trouble the visiting sub-continent team on green-tops . Skipper Brendon McCullum , who has led the team with aplomb , returns , after being rested for the ODI series in UAE , and along with the in-form Kane Williamson will look to manage the bulk of New Zealand 's batting. At Christchurch , New Zealand face a selection dilemma between playing a four-prong seam attack or leaving out one of Doug Bracewell or Neil Wagner in favour of off-spinner Mark Craig . Sri Lanka : Like Brendon McCullum , Sri Lanka have in Angelo Mathews , a captain in fine form , and one who leads from the front. However , they 've had a mixed bag in 2014. They lost at home to the No. 1 Test side , South Africa , in between series wins in England and at home against Pakistan. They were whitewashed in an ODI series in India but recovered to inflict a heavy defeat to the visiting England ODI side. But , come Friday , they will take the field in Christchurch without two of their finest match winners. While Mahela Jayawardene retired from the longest format of the game in October , top wicket-taker of 2014 , Rangana Herath , has been ruled out with a hamstring problem . The pressure of putting up runs firmly falls on the shoulders of the age-defying Kumar Sangakkara , Mathews and Lahiru Thirimanne. Sri Lanka , however , have the liberty of choosing from five quicks capable of bowling at speeds close to 140 kmph in Suranga Lakmal , Shaminda Eranga , Dhammika Prasad , Nuwan Pradeep and Dushmantha Chameera. Dilruwan Perera , is likely to operate as the lone spinner . Pitch and Conditions : Test cricket returns to Christchurch after nine years and the teams will be received on a green carpet of a pitch. A lot of grass is expected to be left on the pitch for the quicks to exploit. Clear skies are forecast for the first two days of the game . Statistics : New Zealand have not lost any of their last five Test series . Angelo Mathews averages 86.62 in 13 Tests as captain . Quotes : " It is green. It 's fair to say it 's going to favour the quicks. The fast bowlers have certainly got a smile on their faces " - NZ batting coach , Craig McMillan on the pitch at the Hagley Oval .
