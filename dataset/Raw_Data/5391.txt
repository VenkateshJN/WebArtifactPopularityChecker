India requested for a replacement after Ishant was ruled out of ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 after failing a fitness test on Saturday . Ishant played in the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne before pulling out of the rest of the Test series with a knee injury. He was picked for an ODI in the ensuing tri-series but did n't get a bowl as the match got washed out . Mohit Sharma and Dhawal Kulkarni , on standby , were part of the bowlers ' boot camp ahead of the World Cup warmups. Mohit , who played India 's last ODI against England , picking up 2/37 was preferred over Kulkarni , who remained untested in match situations . Mohit , 26 , with 10 wickets in 12 ODIs is known for his propensity to bowl the back-of-the-hand slower delivery. He has been extensively used to bowl in the death overs by MS Dhoni while playing for the Chennai Super Kings in Indian Premier League. Mohit joins Bhuvneshwar Kumar , Mohammad Shami and Umesh Yadav in a four-member pace bowling attack that has been on the receiving end of a fair bit of criticism of late .
