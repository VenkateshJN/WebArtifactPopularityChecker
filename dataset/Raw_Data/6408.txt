Loading comments JMinc on March 6 , 2015 , 4 : 41 GMT There is nothing wrong with the NZ batting line up. Every batsmen has contributed in recent times. Concerns seem to be driven by one incredibly good bowling spell by Mitchell Starc. You cant judge a batting order based on one performance , and Scotland was about run rate , Mccullum and Williamson went early in this game too. Maybe some introspection into the Australian batting line up is needed . RobbieG55 on March 6 , 2015 , 0 : 22 GMT Great to see the cricket sadist hour back. But please do n't take the title of your piece so literally Jarrod. Your interviewee makes good points but his turgid delivery is painful ! Now I understand why Warnie did n't like him. A more lively interviewee that matches your vitality next time please . Popular Videos
