The catch in the 1983 final that brought down a titan , and made Indian cricket 's most unlikely achievement possible shares Play 02 : 59 In 1983 , West Indies were unbeatable. They possessed the most fearsome bowling attack and possibly the most brutal batting line-up that anybody had ever witnessed. The first two World Cups had been demonstrations of Caribbean brilliance. The 1979 victory - a strutting , muscular annihilation of England - established Clive Lloyd 's team as the kings of cricket . The 1983 World Cup was following a predictable script. West Indies stormed to the final , and only Kapil Dev 's Indian team provided a romantic antidote to their muscle , with a silky middle order and an arsenal of friendly medium-pacers . India 's arrival in the final was fun but never a threat. Indeed , once Messrs Marshall , Garner , Holding , and Roberts had despatched India for 183 , the only disappointment was that Viv Richards would be denied a second successive World Cup final century . As if mindful of that predicament , Richards set off like a train - a nuclear-powered one - and India 's powder-puff attack was just that . But then something peculiar happened. Madan Lal persuaded Richards into a mistimed hook over midwicket. The ball rose like a missile , swirling wildly in its descent , and as Kapil ran back , the pressure of the moment and the inevitability of Richards ' triumph meant that nobody expected him to pouch it. But he did - over his shoulder . Time stopped in complete disbelief ; the King had fallen. Some observers swore that Kapil smiled as he prepared for the plummeting cricket ball of history . India were ecstatic , West Indies in disarray - such disarray that they collapsed feebly to defeat. The Caribbean empire had fallen , and an Asian giant was awake .
