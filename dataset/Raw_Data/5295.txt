Mar 13 , 2010 Pathan special fails to stop Mumbai The third season of the Indian Premier League was off to a rocking start with Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals involved in a 420-run humdinger. Batting first , the Mumbai based franchise amassed 212 from their allotted 20 overs , with Ambati Rayudu and Saurabh Tiwary making fifties. In reply , the Royals quickly slumped to 66/4 and an early finish was on the cards. Enter Yusuf Pathan. The burly right-handed batsman batted in a cavalier fashion and registered the second fastest T20 hundred , a 37-ball effort. It looked like he would seal victory for Shane Warne 's team , but when he was dismissed his team still needed 40 runs from 17 balls. Paras Dogra batted in a spirited manner and brought the target down to 12 off the final over. It was n't to be Rajasthan 's match though , Lasith Malinga 's boxes of tricks were too much for the lower-order batsmen and they finished 4 runs short of Mumbai 's score . Mumbai Indians vs Rajasthan Royals 2nd match , Mumbai Mar 16 , 2010 Bangalore shed off Test team tag The Kings XI Punjab openers hammered 129 runs in 14 overs and the middle-order made the most of the solid start as they finished on 203/3 from just 20 overs. It 's a daunting target no doubt and it becomes even tougher when the chasing team had been nicknamed as a 'bunch of Test specialists'. After a miserable 2008 season , Royal Challengers Bangalore had proved the naysayers wrong with a strong performance in the 2009 season , albeit in South Africa. Could they repeat it at home ? It was their first home game at the batting friendly Chinnaswamy stadium and the hosts were left to chase 204. Ravi Bopara ( 77 ) and MS Bisla ( 75 ) had added 129 runs for the first wicket and although , Yuvraj Singh ( 9 ) was dismissed cheaply , the men from Punjab held the aces . Manish Pandey and Jacques Kallis had other ideas though. The pair put together 74 runs for the first wicket before the former fell. Robin Uthappa smashed a 19-ball 50 as Bangalore cruised home. Kallis played the anchor role to perfection , remaining unbeaten on 89. Bangalore had turned up in style. They were n't the team that was laughed around in 2008 . Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Kings XI Punjab 7th match , Bengaluru Mar 21 , 2010 The first tie of 2010 At several stages of the match , Kings XI Punjab looked down and out. Batting first , they never quite got going despite Yuvraj Singh 's 28-ball 43 and finished with a moderate 136. Chennai Super Kings were cruising along in the chase , reaching 94/1 after 12 overs. Juan Theron struck twice in the 13th over and panic set in the Chennai ranks. They dawdled along towards the target , which was less then run-a-ball. Eventually , Ravichandran Ashwin needed 1 run from 2 balls , he failed to do so and the match went into the one-over eliminator . Batting first , Chennai managed only nine runs before losing two of their nominated batsmen , Matthew Hayden and Suresh Raina. Left with a task of scoring 10 runs , Punjab 's Mahela Jayawardene hoisted Muttiah Muralitharan for a huge six off the first ball. The wily off-spinner extracted revenge next ball , having his national captain caught at long-on , but a reverse sweep from Yuvraj Singh secured the winning runs for Kings XI Punjab. The victory was significant , it was the first time that Kings XI Punjab had managed to beat Chennai Super Kings in the history of IPL . Chennai Super Kings vs Kings XI Punjab 16th match , Chennai Apr 03 , 2010 469 runs in 40 overs A feast for statisticians , Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals were involved in a run-fest at Chepauk in the 32nd match of the Indian Premier League. On a placid track , Murali Vijay made merry , making a superb 127 , his personal best. He was well supported by Albie Morkel ( 62 ) . Together , the two put on 152-runs for the third wicket , a record stand in the history of the Indian Premier League. 91 runs were scored from the first 10 overs ; another 155 were plundered in the next 10. Chennai ended up on a massive 246/5 , then the highest score in an IPL match. Not to be outshone , the Royals hit back in splendid fashion. Naman Ojha remained unbeaten on 94 , Shane Watson chipped in with 60 and if not for Doug Bollinger 's brilliant figures of 2/15 , the Royals might have even chased down the target. They finished at 223/5 , 23 short of a monumental achievement. For the record , 469 remains the highest aggregate in a T20 match . Chennai Super Kings vs Rajasthan Royals 32nd match , Chennai Apr 05 , 2010 Rajasthan punish Deccan 's profligacy Batting first , Rajasthan never quite got going but still ended up with a decent 159 on the board. The charge for Shane Warne 's men was laid by his Australian team-mate , Shane Watson. The powerful all-rounder blitzed 58 from 36 balls and received useful support from Faiz Fazal ( 36 ) . Still , 159 was just about a par score on a good Nagpur deck. RP Singh and his swing turned out to be too much for the Royals as they managed just 31 runs in the final five overs , imploding from 128/4 to 159 all-out . Rohit Sharma led Hyderabad 's chase after Adam Gilchrist 's 17-ball 34 had given them a head start. Shane Warne threatened to turn the match around in the 18th over , scalping two wickets and conceding just 4 runs. He would finish with astounding figures of 4/21 from his four overs. Rohit 's presence was vital for Hyderabad as they reached the last over with 6 needed for victory and three wickets in hand. Siddarth Trivedi had the ball in his hand. After conceding 2 runs from the first two balls , Trivedi had RP Singh holing out to mid-off , Harmeet Singh was run-out next ball after attempting a second run. The target was now 3 off 2 balls with Rohit on strike. Trivedi maintained his composure as he delivered yet another slower ball. Rohit was early into his lofted off-drive and found sweeper cover to perfection. From nowhere , Rajasthan Royals had snatched victory from the jaws of defeat . Deccan Chargers vs Rajasthan Royals 36th match , Nagpur Apr 18 , 2010 Dhoni takes Super Kings to semis A must win match , and MS Dhoni came to the middle with his team stuttering at 92/2 in the 10th over. It was n't an easy chase either. Powered by a stunning 57-ball 88 from Shaun Marsh , Kings XI Punjab had finished with 192/3 in their 20 overs. Suresh Raina provided the early sparkle , but Chennai still had plenty to do when he was dismissed , caught in the deep off Theron for 46. With Dhoni taking his time to settle , Subramaniam Badrinath made sure that the chase was on the right track. His 36-ball 53 had set up a grandstand finish. Chennai needed 44 from the last 3 overs for a place in the semis . After Albie Morkel collected two boundaries off VRV Singh in the 18th over , the equation read 29 from 2 overs. Dhoni took Theron for two boundaries off the first 2 balls of the 19th over. Theron though limited the damage and Chennai needed 16 from the final over , to be bowled by Irfan Pathan. The first ball was pounded wide of long-off for a boundary , a slower ball was top-edged , only to fall in front of Piyush Chawla at long-on , the third ball was bludgeoned over long-on , one of the biggest six at the Dharamsala ground. With the match all but sealed , Dhoni raised his fifty in style , with another massive six over long-on. Dhoni then let go of emotions , for the first time ever on the cricket field. He had carried his team into the semis . Kings XI Punjab vs Chennai Super Kings 54th match , Dharamsala Apr 21 , 2010 Pollard special knocks out Bangalore One of the most sought after buys in the 2010 auctions , Kieron Pollard proved his worth with an all-round performance to derail Bangalore in the semi-final. Walking into bat with his team precariously placed at 77/4 , the two young Indians in the Mumbai middle-order , Rayudu and Tiwary , had done well to stitch together an enterprising stand worth 67 runs for the fifth wicket. Pollard , who walked into bat with just 14 balls remaining , took the majority of the strike and biffed a 13-ball 33 to take his team to a massive 184/5 from 20 overs . Bangalore was still not out of the contest. With the solid Rahul Dravid and the dangerous Uthappa in the middle , the team looked primed for a late assault. Pollard had other ideas though. His four-over spell wrecked the heart out of Bangalore 's batting. He dismissed Uthappa , Kohli and Manish Pandey in quick succession and Bangalore never recovered. Eventually , they limped across to 149/9 , falling short by 35 runs . Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Mumbai Indians 1st Semi-Final , Mumbai Apr 25 , 2010 Raina steers Chennai to title The final of the 2010 edition of the Indian Premier League was decided on two counts. Batting first , Suresh Raina 's 35-ball 57 carried Chennai to a fighting 168/6 from their 20 overs. Dropped on 13 and 28 , the southpaw made Mumbai pay , guiding his team to a more than a useful score. There were some nice little contributions from the others as well. Vijay made 26 , Dhoni made 22 and Morkel chipped in with 15 . Sachin Tendulkar steered Mumbai 's ship with a watchful 48. He needed support at the other end , but the team management bungled , promoting Abhishek Nayar to three , ahead of Tiwary and Rayudu. Nayar made 27 , but by the time he was dismissed , run-out for 27 , the required rate had gone well past 11 RPO. In another baffling move , Harbhajan Singh was promoted to No. 4. The move failed spectacularly and the pressure was on the hosts. Shadab Jakati struck twice in the 15th over , but Mumbai 's batting-order remained unchanged. Pollard eventually walked in at eight , with his team needing 55 runs from three overs. He did his best , slamming a 10-ball 27 , but it was too little too late. Chennai romped home for their maiden IPL title by a margin of 22 runs . Chennai Super Kings vs Mumbai Indians Final , Mumbai
