He started playing cricket only at the age of 17 and immediately made headlines with his pleasing strokeplay. Playing for Tamil Nadu in domestic cricket , he forged a strong opening combination with another young talent , Abhinav Mukund. They both made headlines when they were involved in a 462 run partnership for the opening wicket in a Ranji Trophy game. Even though they fell short of the world record by just 2 runs , Murali Vijay 's potential had not gone unnoticed and soon he was picked to make his Test debut against Australia in the fourth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , in Nagpur , in November 2008. He was selected for the match after Gautam Gambhir received a one-Test ban for elbowing Shane Watson in the third Test of the same series at the Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi . Vijay had a solid debut Test match making 33 and 40 and impressed one and all with his assured batting. Strong both of the back and front foot , Vijay is merciless when in the mood. Not afraid to dance down the wicket against the spinners , he is known to take the game by the scruff of the neck. He also has the ability to play the long innings - with the aforementioned 462 run partnership being an example . Vijay is a fine close fielder as well. He fielded brilliantly in the close cordon in his debut Test with his quick silver reflexes accounting for Mike Hussey who was sensationally run-out while attempting a single. Earlier in the innings he had run-out Matty Hayden as well with a direct-hit. It was a debut to remember for Vijay as India clinched the series 2-0 . He continued his good form in the lone opportunity , in the last Test , that he got in the 3-match series against Sri Lanka as well. In and out of the side , Vijay 's maiden hundred in the longest format came at Bangalore against the mighty Australians in October 2010. But in the next nine innings he failed to get a fifty and he was quickly out of the side. After a fruitful 2012-13 domestic season he was back in the reckoning , this time at the expense of out-of-form Gautam Gambhir. He made a mark almost immediately , as he made 167 - his second century and his highest score in Test cricket . Vijay , for a long time , had been looked upon as a back-up opener in Test cricket as the duo of Gambhir and Sehwag were going strong. The right-hander had to wait a while before finally making his ODI debut in 2010 against the visiting Proteas in Ahmedabad. But his 50-over career is not that convincing , with him failing to go past 50 on a single occasion. He failed to grab the back-up opener 's slot for the 2011 World Cup . Vijay was picked up by the Chennai to play in the IPL and he played in a couple of games for them in season 2 without making much of an impression. But the 2010 edition was completely different , people were stunned to see the ease at which he plays the pick-up shot over mid-wicket and often deposits the ball way over the fence. Eventually he ended the season as the second highest run-getter in his side , which also includes a memorable 56-ball 127 against Rajasthan , the highest individual score for any player in the entire season. Since then , Vijay has gone on to be a consistent performer for his franchise , especially in knock-out matches. He was the highest run getter in the 2010 Champions League in South Africa , which CSK won. He was the Man of the Final in the 2011 edition as his 52 ball 95 helped CSK overcome RCB to clinch the title. He also scored his second IPL century when he smashed Delhi out of the competition in the Qualifiers of IPL 2012. In the next edition , however , he lacked consistency and was only able to score 312 runs with just 2 fifties . When Australia toured India in Feb/March 2013 and Vijay was selected for the full tour , he grabbed the opportunity with both hands. He smashed two back-to-back 150s in the 2nd and 3rd Tests. He finished the series as the top run-getter with a total of 430 runs ( including 2 centuries and one fifty ) . His superb form earned him an ODI recall for the Champions Trophy in June 2013. However , his poor form in the warm-up games prevented him from being a part of the playing XI. A month later , he was selected for the tri-nation series along with West Indies and Sri Lanka but only managed to rake up scores of 20s and 30s in the 3 games that he played . In Tendulkar 's farewell series in November 2013 , Vijay failed to score much and ended up with only 69 runs in two Tests. He travelled to South Africa and made a well complied 97 in the second Test at Durban but did not manage to put up any notable performances in New Zealand . Given his reputation in the IPL , he was bought by the Delhi at the 2014 auctions after Chennai decided not to retain him after the 6th edition of the league . by Cricbuzz staff
