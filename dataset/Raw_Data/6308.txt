Though that speed of scoring is typical for Maxwell , there was something different this time - before his manic innings at No. 8 , Victoria had made the worst ever start to a Shield innings. The scores of their top seven batsmen read : 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 9 , 0. They had lost six wickets for 9 before Maxwell clobbered 127 of Victoria 's 186 . From 77 for 6 to 675 for 9 dec Rajshahi Division were 77 for 6 at lunch on the first day against Chittagong Division in Bangladesh 's National Cricket League on April 12. What followed was one of the most stunning turnarounds. First , allrounder Farhad Reza and No. 8 Sanjamul Islam added 347 , the third-highest seventh-wicket stand in first-class history , before Muktar Ali went on a six-hitting spree on day two , sending the ball over the ropes 16 times to equal the record for most sixes in a first-class innings. Reza made 259 , Sanjamul scored 172 , Muktar blasted 168 , and Rajshahi eventually declared for 675 for 9. Chittagong lost by 403 runs . 69 to defend ? That 's plenty For three and a half days at the Providence Stadium , Guyana were all over Barbados in their Professional Cricket League game.

Veerasammy Permaul picked up 12 wickets , including eight in the first innings , and Guyana were left with a target of 69 for a straightforward win. Then , on a wearing fourth-day pitch , they collapsed against... Dwayne Smith , who took his first five-for in 13 years of first-class cricket.

No problem Islamabad Leopards were shot out for 54 in the first innings against Multan Tigers. Five of their batsmen were dismissed for ducks , and extras top-scored with 18.

Their turnaround was scripted by a 323-run partnership between Imad Wasim and Faizan Riaz. Wasim 's 207 and Riaz 's 158 helped Leopards to 575 , after which a six-wicket haul from Zohaib Ahmed finished off Tigers .
