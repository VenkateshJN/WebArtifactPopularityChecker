Spinners have averaged 43.68 runs per wicket so far , the worst in any World Cup since 1979 shares 7 Daniel Vettori has been one of the few success stories among spinners in this World Cup taking eight wickets at an average of 14.75 and an economy rate of 3.33 Â© Getty Images When the 2015 World Cup began , it was expected that spinners would struggle a bit to make the same sort of impact that they had in 2011. Then , the conditions in the subcontinent , along with the use of only one new ball in an innings , made it ideal for spinners to have a huge impact on the tournament. They bowled 47 % of the total overs , and it was n't unusual to see a spinner open the bowling and bowl within the first ten overs . In the first 26 games of the 2015 tournament , the spin contribution has gone largely according to the script. Imran Tahir , Daniel Vettori and R Ashwin have shown that skillful spinners still have a place in ODIs regardless of the rules and the conditions , but they - and a handful of others - have been the exceptions. Among the 35 bowlers who 've taken five or more wickets in the tournament so far , only four are spinners , of which one is Chris Gayle. The other three - Tahir , Vettori and Ashwin - have all been exceptional , and are among the 13 bowlers to have taken 13 or more wickets. They have outstanding averages and economy rates too : Ashwin has eight wickets conceding 13.37 runs per wicket and 3.82 per over ; for Vettori the corresponding numbers are 14.75 and 3.33 , while Tahir 's average has been 19.88 and economy rate 4.47 . The stats for Vettori and Ashwin are among the best for any bowler so far in this competition , but most of the other top slots are filled by the fast bowlers. The four leading wicket-takers are Tim Southee , Josh Davey , Mitchell Starc and Trent Boult , while others like Sohail Khan , Wahab Riaz , Kyle Abbott , Mohammed Shami , Hamid Hasan , Tendai Chatara and a few others have all had at least memorable bowling performance . In the tournament so far , spinners have averaged more than 43 runs per wicket , which is the worst in a World Cup since 1979 , when they averaged 65.25. It 's marginally poorer than the 1999 tournament , when they averaged 40.71 per wicket. Their contribution in terms of overs has come down from 47 % in 2011 to 33 % , while the economy rate has gone up to 5.25 , a 14 % jump from the rate of 4.60 in 2011. ( For fast bowlers , the increase has been 10 % . ) The last time the tournament was hosted by Australia and New Zealand - in 1992 - spinners had averaged 35.29 , at an economy rate of 4.16. The economy rate has increased by 25 % for spinners and 35 % for fast bowlers , but while the averages for fast bowlers has remained almost the same , for spin the average has gone up too .
