( AP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 BIRMINGHAM : Ajinkya Rahane smashed his maiden ODI century as India clinched their first 50-over series win on English soil in 24 years after thrashing the hosts by nine wickets in the fourth one-dayer to take an invincible 3-0 lead in the five-match series on Tuesday . India last won a bilateral ODI series in England in 1990. Back then , the tourists won both the matches in the two-match series -- at Leeds ( by six wickets ) and Nottingham ( by five wickets ) . Opting to bowl on Tuesday , the visitors first restricted England to a modest 206 and then overwhelmed the target in 30.3 overs to record their third consecutive victory in the ODI series at the the Edgbaston , in what turned out to be yet another lopsided contest . While Rahane destroyed the pedestrian English attack with a 100-ball 106 with the help of 10 fours and four sixes , an woefully out-of-form Shikhar Dhawan ( 97 not out ; 11x4s , 4x6s ) also re-discovered his touch as the opening duo put on 183-run partnership off 28.4 overs to lay the foundation for the comfortable win . It was a dramatic turnaround for India after the shambolic 1-3 drubbing in the recent Test series , in which the batsmen struggled to cope up with the swinging ball . Earlier electing to bowl , Indian bowlers produced a disciplined effort to bundle out England for a below-par 206 with Moeen Ali 's 67 being the top-score for the hosts . Ali 's second ODI fifty guided England to a score of respectability as the hosts were bowled out in 49.3 overs as they wasted a perfect first-use of a good batting surface with only three batsmen crossing the 20-run mark . Ali faced 50 balls , hitting four boundaries and three sixes , while Mohammad Shami ( 3-28 ) ended up as India 's best bowler on the day. He was ably supported by Bhuvneshwar Kumar ( 2-14 ) and Ravindra Jadeja ( 2-40 ) , while R Ashwin ( 1-48 ) and Suresh Raina ( 1-36 ) were the other wicket-takers . Playing his first ODI , Dhawal Kulkarni ( 0-35 ) went wicket-less in his seven overs . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
