Set up autonomous body to run IPL : Modi The author has posted comments on this article PTI | May 9 , 2014 , 09.17PM IST " I would remove the IPL from under the BCCI and put it in the hands of a separate company , " Lalit Modi said. ( Getty Images ) Page 1 of 4 NEW DELHI : Former IPL commissioner Lalit Modi has suggested the setting up of an autonomous body , independent of the BCCI , to run the cash-rich T20 league . " I would remove the IPL from under the BCCI and put it in the hands of a separate company , " Modi said . The controversial former IPL commissioner , who has been living in exile after being slapped with a life ban , was on Tuesday elected president of the Rajasthan Cricket Association , prompting a livid BCCI to suspend the RCA . " They can have the ownership , let them earn the revenue but allow autonomy to the independent company. Bring in professionals that have nothing else but to run the IPL , " Modi was quoted as saying by 'ESPNcricinfo' . Modi said it is important to involve the franchise owners in the decision-making process . " The league 's board would have franchise owners on it. And the company would then send in an annual report to the BCCI. That is how it should be. The owners need to have a big say in it. You can not have a system that keeps changing rules like retention to suit one 's own needs , " he said . Modi predictably swept the RCA polls , winning by an emphatic 24-5 margin after the Supreme Court cleared the decks for the announcement of the election results , more than four months after the acrimonious polls .
