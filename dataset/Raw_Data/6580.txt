ODI runs : 3961 Debut : 2001 Maskadza has been out of form at just the wrong times when it comes to World Cups. He played in virtually all of his side 's matches for about a year in the lead-up to both the 2007 and 2011 events , but missed out on both. He was back in the Zimbabwe team for the very next match after the marquee tournaments , though. He was absent in 2003 for a different reason - focusing on his studies at the University of the Free State . Rohit has an unhappy knack of picking up injuries. If he does n't succumb to one this time , he could be one of the stars of 2015. © AFP ODI runs : 3752 Debut : 2007 Rohit would n't have been without a World Cup game to his name this long if he had seized his chance in the South Africa series immediately before the 2011 World Cup. However , he floundered then , extending his World Cup wait by four years . No international ODI captain is struggling to justify his place as much as Cook , but he is strongly backed by the ECB © Getty Images ODI runs : 3151 Debut : 2006 Cook is yet to turn 30 but already has more than 8400 Test runs. His one-day record is less stellar , though , and the debate rages over whether he deserves a spot in the ODI side. In 17 innings this year , he has a sub-30 average and his strike rate is in the low 70s. Still , he is set to lead England in next year 's tournament . The presence of Sachin Tendulkar , Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir meant Dhawan had a long wait for his ODI chance © AFP ODI runs : 2046 Debut : 2011 Dhawan played only one ODI before the 2011 World Cup , getting a golden duck against Australia in 2010 . He got another chance when the senior players rested after the victorious 2011 campaign , but it was n't till 2013 that he established himself in ODIs with a Man-of-the-Series performance in the Champions Trophy . Having fallen behind other contenders for the wicketkeeping slot , Chandimal might yet have a long wait ahead for a World Cup game © AFP ODI runs : 1962 Debut : 2010 Still only 25 , Chandimal has already had a rollercoaster ride in ODIs. Two centuries , including one at Lord 's , in his first six ODIs seemed to signal the arrival of a player for the long run. Two years on , he was stand-in captain of the side. However , there have been no more hundreds since , and Chandimal is now on the fringes of Sri Lanka 's one-day team . © ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
