ICC in no hurry to restrict bat size : Richardson The author has posted comments on this article Santosh Suri , TNN | Feb 11 , 2015 , 11.14AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 ADELAIDE : ICC CEO Dave Richardson has said that the world body is in no hurry to re strict the size of bats and that the issue will be taken up only after the World Cup . Of late , the ICC has shown concern that the meaty bats have led to an imbalance between bat and the ball , with batsmen dominating and bowlers taking a hammering . After facing criticism , especially from some star batsmen , on the move to restrict the size of the bats , rather than revisiting other factors like smaller boundaries and two new balls in ODIs , the ICC , it seems , has gone on the back foot. It will now review the issue thoroughly before taking any decision . Richardson said that many factors needed to be weighed in and taken into consideration before deciding on the issue. He said that besides the ICC committee , there is also the MCC as a law-maker and its opinion will be of " great value " . He also said that there were other factors that have led to bat dominating ball . " We need to see what impact two new balls , shorter boundaries and better pitches have had on this factor. I think it 's a little too premature to speak with absolute certainty. But it is one of the factors or one of the measures that need to be considered going forward. That will be done at the ICC cricket committee after this World Cup in May .The MCC also have a number of committees that looks at laws. The next law committee meeting will be more or less in that same timeframe. " Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
