Court rejects life ban petition for Pakistan 's Aamer The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Mar 24 , 2015 , 07.04PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 KARACHI : A Pakistani court on Tuesday dismissed a legal petition seeking a life ban on fast bowler Mohammad Aamer , just weeks after he returned to domestic cricket following a spot-fixing suspension . The International Cricket Council ( ICC ) gave permission for the left-armer to return early to domestic cricket from his five-year ban over the infamous spot-fixing episode in a Test against England in 2010 . Lawyer Rana Faizul Hassan filed a petition in the Sindh High Court in February calling for the 22-year-old to be banned for life to stop him damaging the image of Pakistan and cricket . But on Tuesday the court threw out the application after Hassan repeatedly failed to show up for hearings . " The Sindh High Court today rejected my petition of demanding lifetime ban on Mohammad Aamer on non-persecution basis , " Hassan told AFP . Hassan said he had not been able to appear before the court because of his " busy " schedule and a two-judge bench dismissed the case . Aamer made his comeback in Pakistani grade-two cricket , one rung below first class , on March 13 , taking three wickets in his first spell of bowling . He was one of three Pakistani players banned from cricket for at least five years for arranging no-balls to order , in the Lord 's Test against England in 2010 . He was also jailed in Britain in 2011 , along with former capital Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif . Aamer 's ban was due to expire on September 2 2015 , but the International Cricket Council used discretionary powers to allow him to return to domestic cricket early .
