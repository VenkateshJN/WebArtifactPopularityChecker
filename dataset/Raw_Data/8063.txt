Scotland 's all-round brilliance in the seventh warm-up match of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 took the side to a 179-run win against Ireland on Tuesday ( February 10 ) . Matt Machan was Scotland â€™ s star , hitting a 108-ball 103 to power the side to a dominant 296 for 6 after it elected to bat first at the Blacktown Olympic Park Oval in Sydney. Alasdair Evans then picked up 4 for 17 to keep Ireland down to 117 all out in 27 overs . Machan resurrected the innings skillfully , having walked in with his team 42 for 2 after Max Sorensen struck early by prising out Kyle Coetzer for 0 before trapping Hamish Gardiner leg before for 12 . Calum MacLeod combined with Machan to add a steadying 44 runs for the third wicket , but George Dockrell had MacLeod caught for 41. Machan then associated with Preston Mommsen , the captain , for the first of two defining partnerships in the match . The duo put on 96 for the fourth wicket off 123 balls before Sorensen struck for a third time when he had Mommsen caught for 56 . Richie Berrington ( 52 off 40 ) then joined Machan for a 98-run stand for the fifth wicket that changed the course of the innings. The partnership , which came off just 60 balls , negated Ireland 's early advantage and pushed Scotland towards a formidable total . It was Craig Young who broke the stand when he castled Machan. But by then , Machan had stroked his way to a fantastic century , studded with six fours and four sixes . Sorensen was the main striker for Ireland , taking 3 for 55 runs from 10 overs. Young finished with 2 for 30 off six , while Dockrell had the lone scalp of MacLeod . Ireland 's chase began on a positive note , William Porterfield ( 23 ) , the captain , and Paul Stirling ( 37 ) putting on 57 for the opening wicket in 11.5 overs. Once Evans provided the breakthrough though , Scotland had an advantage which it did n't let slip. Ireland lost nine wickets for 60 runs , with only Gary Wilson going into double figures among the rest of the batsmen. . Scotland hunted in a pack with the ball. While Evans was the pick of the lot , Majid Haq was the most economical , his four overs costing just nine runs apart from fetching him three wickets. Josh Davey returned 3 for 36 off his seven , while Iain Wardlaw , Scotland 's new-ball bowler , finished with 1 for 36 off six . Share this article :
