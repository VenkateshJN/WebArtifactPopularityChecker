Sachin Tendulkar See results » If Richards could do anything with a bat , the same could be said of Wasim Akram with the ball. In a career that lasted nearly two decades Akram developed from a young tearaway to a masterful swing bowler who could bowl six different deliveries in an over. He finished with 502 wickets - still comfortably the most for a fast bowler. The day it mattered the most , in March 1992 , he finished as Man of the Match . In terms of longevity and batting numbers Sachin Tendulkar has no equal. Starting as a teenage prodigy who batted in the lower middle order , Tendulkar went on to become the definitive one ­ day opener - fire ­ starting the innings and then settling down to bat long. He ended with a mammoth 18,426 runs and 49 centuries - records that may not be bettered for many years to come. And he won games with the ball too . The Cricket Monthly 's 50-member jury includes legendary cricketers Ian Chappell , Clive Lloyd , Martin Crowe , Rahul Dravid , Ricky Ponting and Graeme Smith ; veteran commentators Tony Cozier , Mark Nicholas , Mike Haysman and Sanjay Manjrekar ; and respected writers Gideon Haigh , Mike Coward , Suresh Menon and Mike Selvey . " No one does numbers better than us , " said ESPNcricinfo 's editor-in ­ -chief Sambit Bal , " but we also know that numbers do n't always tell the full story. Which is why we rely on the cumulative wisdom of those who should know for our awards . " And the World Cup was a good occasion to assemble a grand jury - drawn from different eras and countries - to pick the greatest ever one-day cricketer. It 's hard to argue with the top five the poll has thrown up : between them they encapsulate the best of ODI cricket across the ages and also its evolution. " The March issue of the Cricket Monthly published on Tuesday , 10 March , will include full results of the poll , celebrations of the top five , an interview with the winner of the title , and more . © ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
