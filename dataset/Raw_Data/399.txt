England will face off against Australia in the tournament opener on Friday . © AFP England begin life with Alastair Cook. Australia are without Michael Clarke. New captains , new ambitions but with similar goals. With the World Cup a little less than month away , the tri-series will help iron out the edges for sure . England have impressed in their two warm-up matches against an Invitational XI and a Prime Minister 's XI. According to Sky Sports , Ian Botham is tipping 7/4 shots England to win their opening tri-Series match against Australia in Sydney. Ian Bell has made a blistering start to the tour , including 187 in Wednesday 's victory over the Prime Minister 's XI but a lot will depend on Joe Root and Moeen Ali. Both have proved to be match-winners in the recent past . Australia have a terrific captain in George Bailey. The Tasmanian is in the top 10 of the ICC 's one-day batting rankings. He needs 55 runs to break David Boon 's record as the fastest to 2000 ODI runs for Australia. He is the captain for this series , and likely for the start of the World Cup . The fourth Test between India and Australia was played at the Sydney. If the pitch remains the same , then there should be a run feast. This series will be a test for Morgan , who has captained England in eight ODIs and averages 71.16 as leader .
