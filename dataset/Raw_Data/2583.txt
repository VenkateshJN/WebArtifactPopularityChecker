Umpires Richard Kettleborough and Richard Smith took the decision after a 2 : 00pm local time ( 1300GMT ) inspection , ruling the outfield too wet for any play . It had rained heavily overnight and further rain in the morning also left damp patches on the pitch . Sri Lanka won the two-match series 1-0 after their 79-run victory in Dublin on Tuesday . Sri Lanka 's tour continues with a one-day match against county side Essex on Monday , one of several 'warm-up ' fixtures ahead of limited overs and Test series with England .
