OLDEST gudolerhum on April 10 , 2015 , 17 : 46 GMT Thanks , Tony , for this tribute to Richie. He has been an integral part of cricket in my life ; from the 1955 tour of the West indies when I watched him at Kensington Oval. I recall listening to the tied Test and his partnership with Alan Davidson that took Australia so close to victory and then the final unbelievable tense ending. Thanks to Richie for his genius on the field as player and captain and later as commentator. There will never be another like him. My condolences to his widow , Daphne and his other loved ones. May he resit in peace. A life well lived to the fullest . on April 10 , 2015 , 18 : 47 GMT We as viewers and ardent fan of this game.. lost the 'Voice of Cricket ' ! ! RIP Richie Benaud. . GrindAR on April 10 , 2015 , 17 : 41 GMT In my age , I 've known him as a best commentator of the game. He extended the beauty of the game into his commentary box. Made the game look even beautiful. One has to have the immense cricketing skills to call beauties aptly on time and at the heat of the moment , not worrying about your team winning or loosing. He will be missed dearly . Sriram.Raj on April 10 , 2015 , 16 : 13 GMT Richie Benaud made cricket viewing a pleasurable experience unlike the frenzy and tension that is seen on today 's cricket viewing. He let the viewer enjoy the game like a movie and filled the gaps where required with his expert opinion. In short , Richie Benaud was to television commentary what Trevor Bailey was to Radio commentary , " the real expert " on April 10 , 2015 , 14 : 43 GMT Excellent tribute worthy of the man. Had the privilege of attending his speech here all these years ago - the memory remains . bobmartin on April 10 , 2015 , 14 : 27 GMT Such a pity that commentators of his stature are a dying breed... To paraphrase Winston Churchill : " We shall never see his like again. His name will live in history... It will live in the legends of cricket , both players and commentators.' Arijit_in_TO on April 10 , 2015 , 14 : 15 GMT He embodied what was right with cricket when I grew up watching him on the BBC in the 1970s - early 80s. A Man of Class and Poise. A lovely tribute by Mr. Cozier . BRUTALANALYST on April 10 , 2015 , 13 : 17 GMT Thanks for sharing Tony lovely story SauronsSon on April 10 , 2015 , 12 : 54 GMT Thanks , Tony. He was of a different vintage. Remember having breakfast with him in a chilly 1972 morning outside of Oxford. Spoke little. The less he said , the more the gravity of those silent words . on April 10 , 2015 , 11 : 24 GMT Thanks Tony. That would be a great Lunch. Glad you got one last chance to enjoy his company gudolerhum on April 10 , 2015 , 17 : 46 GMT Thanks , Tony , for this tribute to Richie.

RIP Mr Benaud on April 10 , 2015 , 9 : 57 GMT This was a great man who played and lived cricket with honor , reverence , respect and dignity. His was an innings of true magnificence. He now looks down at us from high alongside " Johnnos " on April 10 , 2015 , 9 : 49 GMT Richie Benaud 's voice is so distinctive , he will always be a part of the game. Having said that however , and I do n't want to overshadow a great article , but his commentary was really biased in my opinion . on April 10 , 2015 , 9 : 48 GMT Thanks Mr. Cozier. A fine tribute to a cricketer and commentator beloved and respected wherever the game is played. And , you 're in the same class . SHK1 on April 10 , 2015 , 5 : 47 GMT A true legend. Do n't make like him anymore . banglafan on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 53 GMT Richie Benaud was our childhood hero . Akoben on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 50 GMT Along with yourself Mr Cozier , I grew up on two dsitingtive voices teaching me and guiding me as I pursued the game of my father , Cricket. Mr Richie Benaud is still one of the standard bearers of cricket journalism. His style will be greatly missed as well as memorably remembered . Enjoy the journey Mr Benaud . IndianInnerEdge on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 40 GMT Thanks Tony for this wonderful write up , just goes to show the affection in which Richie was held , always correct , laconic sense of humour and absolute treat for the ears. His commentary was always neutral and never nationalistic. On a side note what a wonderful series the 60-61 must have been , for so many to turn up in melbourne to bid farewell to an opponent team , it must be the wonderful competitive spirit in which the series was played that caused this , something i wish my team would someday emulate. That apart , was legendary listening to him along with Greig , bill lawry and ian chappell. Am sure he will be looking down from the heavens checking on the score , the latest innovations and the like...RIP Richie Benaud...cricinfo please publish on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 36 GMT Richie Benaud was probably most respected cricketer in the world today. Whatever he did , he was always in the top bracket. A very innovative and progressive cricketer. The only voice in cricket , which even a deaf was able to understand and comprehend . on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 18 GMT Thanks Tony.I had been following cricket since 1970 between the test match PAK-NZ at Dhaka,now capital of Bangladesh.To my eyes Benaud was a legendary cricket commentator.He was smart in his dress selection.An impartial and ground to earth human being.Never hesitate to praise a cricketer irrespective of his nationality,race and religion.We all will miss you Richie.RIP . on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 05 GMT Thanks Tony for a lovely tribute. I can vouch for Cammie 's infectious laughter. Richie must be going out for the toss with Frankie just about now on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 00 GMT Richie benaud is simply irreplaceable. Thanks for this article to Mr Tony Cozier who is similarly unique. Been following cricket for 31 years from all corners of the globe and ca n't think of any two more valued contributors in their field. Best wishes from Malaysia . ilovetests on April 10 , 2015 , 3 : 42 GMT To Mr Cozier, Thank you for this lovely insight into Benaud - the man behind the legend. Like many Kiwis ( and many from the cricket following world ) I grew up listening and admiring this great Australian commentator ( born after the dashing legspinning allrounder captain had thrown away the whites ) . I have also greatly enjoyed listening to you whenever the Calypso Kings have ventured down to NZ. It is fitting that one great commentator can comment on another . on April 10 , 2015 , 3 : 36 GMT A touching article.Richie will be truly missed.What a fine cricketer and a great commentator.Will never forget the tied test at Brisbane.Remember hearing radio commentary of that memorable match.RIP Richie.Difficult to get a replacement . gudolerhum on April 10 , 2015 , 17 : 46 GMT Thanks , Tony , for this tribute to Richie.
