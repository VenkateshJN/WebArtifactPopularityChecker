( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 LONDON : India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni hinted at stepping down as the captain following his team 's 1-3 Test series loss to England . India lost The Oval Test by an innings and 244 runs on Sunday , triggering questions over Dhoni 's future as the India captain . Asked if he has taken the team as far as he could , Dhoni said : " Maybe , yes. " " You 'll have to wait and watch. If I 'm strong enough or not strong enough , you 'll have to wait and get the news , " Dhoni was quoted as saying by BBC Test Match Special . Dhoni , 33 , took over the Test team in 2008 after leading India to an emphatic win in the inaugural World Twenty20 in 2007. He has led the team in 58 Tests with a record 27 wins . Under Dhoni , India topped the world Test rankings from late 2009 until the summer of 2011 , a period in which he also led the team to victory in the World Cup . But India 's slide started with surrendering their No.1 Test rankings with a 4-0 whitewash in England in 2011 . In the current series , India took a 1-0 lead by winning the Lord 's Test. But from then on things worsened for the visitors , who suffered three consecutive losses , including two innings defeats. They failed 200 in five consecutive attempts that ended with them being bowled out for 94 inside 30 overs at The Oval here Sunday . " The last three Tests , we were not up to the mark , " said Dhoni , who has scored 4,808 runs in 88 Tests. " We never competed. Today 's batting was a reflection of a loss of confidence. It 's disappointing. " " Right from the start , our batsmen have n't performed - it was the lower order. Later on in the series , when the lower order did n't perform , we saw there was n't enough runs on the board , " said Dhoni . Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar also blasted the team for the tame surrender . " I do n't know what to say. What can you say ? You can get angry , say harsh things , but what good will it do ? If you do not want to be playing Test cricket for India , quit. Just play limited-overs cricket. You should not be embarrassing your country like that , " said Gavaskar . India 's last five Test series : July-August 2014 : England ( away ) - lost 3-1 ( 5 Tests ) February 2014 : New Zealand ( away ) - lost 1-0 ( 2 Tests ) December 2013 : South Africa ( away ) - lost 1-0 ( 2 Tests ) November 2013 : West Indies ( home ) - won 2-0 ( 2 Tests ) February-March 2013 : Australia ( home ) - won 4-0 ( 4 Tests ) Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
