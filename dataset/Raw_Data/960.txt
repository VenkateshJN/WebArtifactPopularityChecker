Â© Getty Images West Indies crashed out of the World Cup after slumping to a heavy defeat to New Zealand at Wellington on Saturday. Martin Guptill scored a record unbeaten 237 to pile up 393 for six and put the Windies out of cricket 's mega event. ( Full Coverage ) The West Indian bowling was ransacked by Guptill and their lackluster show has left their former great Brian Lara furious. ( Holder Blames Windies Inconsistency for Exit ) Talking exclusively to NDTV , Lara expressed his disgust and said , " The West Indies bowling is the rubbish of world cricket. " The former Windies skipper acknowledged that New Zealand were too strong for them but questioned West Indies ' mentality for giving up so early in the contest . " New Zealand were very strong but West Indies never showed up " , said Lara , " the minute things got tough , the team threw in the towel. " Ian Chappell too , was saddened by the fall of the West Indies team . " It is sad to see the West Indies playing like this " , said the former Australian skipper , " Over the years every team has taken a hammering from the Windies but now , everyone is sad to see them go down. " Lara though , was furious with the entire team. He pointed out that three of the six double hundreds in ODI cricket have come against the West Indian bowling attack and recently , even the fastest hundred was slammed by AB de Villiers against them . Not only the bowlers , Lara was equally critical of the batsmen . " The batsmen played terrible shots , " said the Trinidadian , " none of the senior players stepped up. I am very disappointed with the effort. " Talking about Guptill 's effort , Chappell too pointed fingers at the West Indian bowling , " Full credit to Guptill for playing such a knock but you ca n't score so many unless the opposition bowling helps you. " West Indies cricket has been in the doldrums for some time now. There 's a serious lack of quality and the West Indian board has done precious little to revive the waning super-power in world cricket. The players and the board have been at logger-heads for some time now and this World Cup exit has raised some difficult questions about the future of the men from the Caribbean .
