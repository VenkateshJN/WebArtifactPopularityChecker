World Cup 2015 : Kiwi fans hit back at Hayden MCG jibe The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Mar 27 , 2015 , 02.40PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 SYDNEY : New Zealand fans poked fun on Friday at Matthew Hayden after the former Australian batsman suggested the Black Caps would be overawed by the huge dimensions of the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the World Cup final . New Zealand go into the championship match on a run of eight wins in eight games at the tournament but all of their matches have been played on their own , much smaller , grounds . " There were a number of times in the semi-final where the New Zealand batsmen appeared to be hitting big balls , but they 'd be getting caught three quarters of the way to the fence at the MCG , " Hayden wrote in his column for www.news.com.au . " Let 's be honest , the size of Eden Park ( in Auckland ) is ridiculous. It should n't be a cricket ground. If you can half throw it from the long off boundary to the opposite end it 's too small. " Hayden 's comments led to an outburst of tongue-in-cheek responses from Kiwi fans , with the hashtag # mcgsobig trending on Twitter . Some of the wittiest included : " # MCGsobig streakers need a drinks break at half way. " " # MCGsobig that the Great Southern Stand is still technically claimed by the Dutch. " " # MCGsobig David Boon could drink 52 beers walking from one side of it to the other. " " The MCG is so big captains issue GPS co-ordinates when making fielding changes. # MCGsobig. " " # MCGsobig The state of Texas can fit in it , twice. " " # MCGsobig @ The_Proclaimers wrote # 500Miles about walking to the changing room. " " # MCGsobig many believe the lost city of Atlantis is somewhere in the outfield between fine leg and 3rd man # CWC15 # BacktheBlackCaps. " " # MCGsobig those are n't lights but large suns from a neighbouring galaxy. " Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
