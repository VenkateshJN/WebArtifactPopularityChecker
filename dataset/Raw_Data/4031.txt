An International Cricket Council spokesman later confirmed to Fairfax Media at least one man was evicted from Hagley Oval for " using his communication devices to provide match information to people outside this country. " Police said plain clothes officers mingled with the 17,000 crowd , on the lookout for " betting cheats " who were making excessive use of laptops or mobile phones . The operation was part of a crackdown on 'courtsiding ' or 'pitchsiding ' in which gamblers take advantage of broadcasting delays to gain an advantage over sports bookmakers . Fairfax Media said police watched a group of men for about 10 minutes , near the end of New Zealand 's innnings , before detectives led them away for questioning. They were taken to a police tent at the ground where they were interviewed before being ejected . The ICC spokesman told Fairfax " we 've got systems in place and these systems are working. People involved in illegal activity are being nabbed and chucked out " We all know there 's a problem and we 're dealing with the problem the best we can. " Courtsiding is not illegal in New Zealand but does breach terms under which spectators are permitted to attend games . " We know what to look for , " Superintendent Sandra Manderson of Christchurch Police told Fairfax. " We 're aware that people are attempting to operate at venues and they will be detected , evicted and trespassed from all venues.
