Last updated on Wednesday , 12 November , 2014 21 : 17 IST Total Shares Mohammad Hafeez hit an unbeaten 101 to help Pakistan declare their second innings on 175-2 . Â© AFP Abu Dhabi : Pakistan produced another ruthless performance to move to the brink of victory in the first Test against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. ( Blog | Scorecard ) A ninth wicket stand of 36 in 14.5 overs between Mark Craig ( 27 ) and Ish Sodhi ( 27 ) delayed Pakistan 's victory on the fourth day at Sheikh Zayed Stadium but New Zealand were struggling on 174-8 after being set a daunting target of 408 . Pakistan need just two wickets on the final day for a 1-0 lead in the three-match series while New Zealand still need 306 for an unlikely win on the fifth and final day . Spinners Zulfiqar Babar ( 2-30 ) and Yasir Shah ( 2-49 ) and seamer Rahat Ali ( 2-38 ) destroyed the New Zealand batting . Earlier , Mohammad Hafeez hit an unbeaten 101 to help Pakistan declare their second innings on 175-2 before the bowlers took over and skittled the Kiwi batsmen . It was a weak batting display by New Zealand who promised a lot before the Test but only Brendon McCullum ( 39 ) , Corey Anderson ( 23 ) and Kane Williamson ( 23 ) offered little resistance . McCullum and Tom Latham ( 20 ) gave New Zealand a confident start of 57 runs before Babar had first innings centurion Latham top-edging a sweep to Shah . Four runs later Shah trapped McCullum and then had Ross Taylor out in the same fashion for eight , leaving New Zealand reeling at 47-3 . Anderson and Williamson added 42 for the fourth wicket but calamity struck as three wickets fell in the space of just five balls . Hafeez had Williamson stumped while Rahat dismissed Jimmy Neesham and BJ Watling off successive deliveries -- both without scoring . Rahat 's pace partner Imran Khan then had Anderson leg-before as the batsman offered no stroke to a straight delivery while Babar cleaned up Tim Southee for five . Hafeez reached his sixth Test hundred , with a couple off McCullum. In all he hit two sixes and 12 boundaries during his 130-ball knock . It was Hafeez 's first century since his 196 against Sri Lanka in July 2012 . The first session saw Younis and Hafeez batting solidly . Younis , who hit a brilliant 100 not out in the first innings , survived a leg-before referral , but he fell soon after lunch to Sodhi , who finished with 2-66 . Hafeez opened up after a cautious start , hitting boundaries off paceman Trent Boult and then he hit two off Sodhi to complete his fifty and follow up on his 96 in Pakistan 's first innings of 566-3 declared . Pakistan , resuming at 15-0 , had looked for quick runs but were checked by disciplined New Zealand bowling . Sodhi removed Azhar Ali for 23 to give his team the early breakthrough . The remaining two Tests will be played in Dubai ( November 17-21 ) and Sharjah ( November 26-30 ) .
