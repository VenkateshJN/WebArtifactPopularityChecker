OLDEST on April 10 , 2015 , 10 : 23 GMT i agree that it is very easy to get out afridi and every team knows rgat can get afridi out quickly but but they also know that if afridi stays they cant stay lolx afridi is best player every team is afraid of him explorer76 on April 9 , 2015 , 16 : 46 GMT @ Khurram : Btw Afridi played 145 matches as an opener which is the second highest by any Pakistani opener. Only Saeed Anwar opened more innings for Pakistan. So you ca n't say he was n't given enough chances as an opener. And unlike what you might think , his average as an opener is n't any better than his career average at only 24.9. In those 145 matches he made only 2 hundreds and 22 fifties , so slightly better at a fifty every 6 matches , but nothing to write home about. There was a reason he was eventually removed from opening position , because even after those 145 innings he was a walking wicket as an opener. So the only thing they could do was to play him at 6 or 7 so he could play his all-guns-out game . explorer76 on April 9 , 2015 , 16 : 20 GMT Khurram , I think you have answered the question for me. Players like jayasuriya , Gayle , AB Deviliers etc are explosive but are still genuine batsman , unlike Afridi who as you said was not a genuine batsman. No one doubts Afridi 's talent , but even after 390 matches he could not develop the temperament to play a longer innings. Even at 6 or 7 he got plenty of chances where he came in with more than 10 overs to play but just swung his way to a couple of sixes and got out. At the same time his bowling while useful was not good enough to justify his place as a specialist bowler. And that 's my problem. He neither is an exceptional bowler nor a great batsman and yet we kept playing him for 398 matches and praise him as a great player. Sum of two average to above-average skills does n't make a great player . on April 9 , 2015 , 0 : 36 GMT EXPLORER76. Do you really mean it ? You are comparing Afridi who comes at 6th or 7th position with Gayle who is an opening batsman. Afridi had much of his success when he was playing as an opener but ever since he was asked to play at 6 or 7 his job was just to play cameos. And , also for your information Afridi was not a genuine batsman. The comparison is just like you comparing Gayle as a bowler with Afridi 's bowling statistics . SSon_cric on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 54 GMT To those who say there will not be another Afridi- yes because no country will ever let a player play 400 ODI matches with a batting average of 23 and a bowling average of 35. Zimbabwe , Bangladesh and West Indies are exceptions to this rule , but no player from these three countries will ever play 400 ODIs ! To those who say he could have done a lot more : he has done what he could , if he had changed his approach he may not have lasted so long. You see , he kept getting selected based on his approach , not his achievements . explorer76 on April 8 , 2015 , 17 : 05 GMT @ TRUEF : " Afridi is most popular in Pak , very unpopular in rest of the world. " Half of Pakistani supporters love Afridi , but half of us ca n't believe that he was allowed to continue for 398 matches ! For those talking about Afridi as an entertainer , what good is the entertainment that lasts for only 3 overs in a 50 overs game. Afridi in his 395 matches made only 6 hundreds and 39 fifties. Think about it - this means that he reached a score of 50 only once every 9 matches ! As a comparison Chris Gayle - another explosive batsman - already has more than 9000 runs in only 269 matches and has 22 hundreds and 47 fifties. So he is giving his team a fifty once every 4 games. I think Gayle is also a fairly reckless batsman but even he is giving real contributions to his team far more often .

All the very best for your future. From Delhi with respect . TrueF on April 7 , 2015 , 17 : 11 GMT Simple definition of Afridi is most popular in Pak , very unpopular in rest of the world. As opponent , we are 100 % sure we can get his wicket , sorry he can give his wicket easily. Reg. his bowling , it is mediocre considering other Pak bowlers , so no impact for opponent teams. This is clearly shown in recent world cup. Bye Bye Afridi . Cashiph on April 7 , 2015 , 16 : 32 GMT Afridi is the only man on the cricket ground for whom I saw play cards " Marry me .. Afridi " .... from girls across the world ... He is like for cricket what David Bekham is for Football .... who cares how good his cricket techniques are its all about entertainment.... do we even care about cricket in leagues like IPL and Big Bash ? .... Shahid Khan Afridi is Father of Modern Cricket ... no doubt on April 7 , 2015 , 16 : 19 GMT He did alot for Pakistan Cricket but the problem was when he was sent at no.7 or no.8 where the pressure was huge and he never enjoyed playing there. His spot was opening he was so destructive in opening that he can take away game in few overs. He should have always opened no matter what he do not waste balls. Pressure use to mount on his early departure but one down good player can take it... . on April 10 , 2015 , 10 : 23 GMT i agree that it is very easy to get out afridi and every team knows rgat can get afridi out quickly but but they also know that if afridi stays they cant stay lolx afridi is best player every team is afraid of him explorer76 on April 9 , 2015 , 16 : 46 GMT @ Khurram : Btw Afridi played 145 matches as an opener which is the second highest by any Pakistani opener.

Ayaz Hussain on April 7 , 2015 , 15 : 41 GMT Afridi is True Legend of Cricket , and will never born a cricketer like him in cricket history ? ? ? Boom Boom we love you and Proud of you ? ? ? Long Live . on April 7 , 2015 , 15 : 23 GMT His batting was always entertaining. But i felt he lost his flair because of his impatience to stay at the crease and give himself a little more chance in the later part of his career . Anyways a cricketer of his own sought Mohammed_paki on April 7 , 2015 , 12 : 05 GMT Since Afridi and Misbah has retired i do n't feel like like watching cricket.From the time i was 8 i use to watch cricket just because of Shahid Afridi.He is a star , i do n't care what anyone say.Shahid Afridi a well as Mibah-Ul-Haq will never be forgotten in cricket history.Both of them are STARS . martinmoha on April 7 , 2015 , 11 : 36 GMT I will consider AFRIDI much much greater than any allrounder in history of ODI 'S CRicket . his style of batting is very very attractive when it comes to power hitting , Dhoni stands no where with afridi when it comes to attractivness of shots while Most of Dhoni 's shots are Immense power hitting but does't look attractive.Afridi will be my first choice for selecting all time best ODI 'S team 1. shahid afridi 2. tendulkar 3. lara 4.vivian richards 5. ricky ponting 6. adam gilchrist 7. wasim akaram 8. walsh 9. mcgrath 10. kallis 11. saqlain/shane warne/murli . imtiazjaleel on April 7 , 2015 , 9 : 59 GMT Afridi if shown some sensibility while batting would have achieved much more. 8 out of 10 times he had thrown his wicket to some reckless shots. The best example is Dhoni who plays according to the situation and therefore considered one of the best finishers especially in ODI and T20 . on April 7 , 2015 , 9 : 23 GMT BOOB BOOB - When i first saw him play , i would have never though one day i will write on him post his retirement , partly , given the brand of people from pakistan you always loved even being a hard core Indian ( Anwars , akrams , khans , and many more ) and partly the absence of common sense in his application , it will be safe to say at least you can add afridi 's to that list , just for pure longevity of existence in the game . on April 7 , 2015 , 6 : 36 GMT If Afridi was born in some develop country like Aus /Sa or even Sl ( case of Jayasuriya ) , he would have finish his cricket with many achievements.He was always unique " Revolutionary " who would have thought in mid 90s that someone will score 100 off 37 balls.Due to uncertain & inconsistent selections of coaches & captains in Pakistan never allowed him to evolve his cricket . on April 7 , 2015 , 6 : 31 GMT Save for the arrival onto the world scene , Afridi was pretty much an over-rated under achiever , mis-handled by the PCB. As an Indian fan , we never ever saw him as a threat , past those initial 3 years. His wicket was a given and often signalled the beginning of the end of an innings . on April 7 , 2015 , 6 : 13 GMT Honestly with the number of games he played and with the amount of batting talent he had he could have easily crossed he 10000 run mark in ODIS .He should have batted sensibly in the later half of his career as he was a senior player but I guess it was his brand of cricket .Probably should have always been at the top of the order especially looking at Pak 's weak top order without any hitters during the WC . remnant on April 6 , 2015 , 23 : 55 GMT Afridi has indeed been a mesmerizing presence but his legacy to Pak cricket has been really a dampener. Since he appeared , it seems , the entire ethos of Pakistan batting has been mutated and now an Afridi lurks in every batsman. And in order to compensate for the so many Afridis , they have to balance it with the tortoises like Misbah and Shafiq etc. Maybe Afridi was a luxury the Pak team of 90s ; with its proper batsman , could afford , but an Afridi today , is an Afridi too many. Power hitting has gone scientific and Afridi is a relic of a bygone age. A valued relic nonetheless . on April 6 , 2015 , 20 : 56 GMT I enjoyed Afridi 's uncomplicated Cricket. Most Often if I learned Afridi was batting , I would put everything off just to watch a few and hope for many overs of just power hitting. Never never boring , often disappointing , however , Afridii is a passionate entertainer. I will still watch him in T20 . isiahbilly on April 6 , 2015 , 19 : 21 GMT Like Andy Zaltsman said " Afridi 's innings are not merely innings , they are performances " . What all the experts and cricket fans forget and dont give him credit for and is rightly pointed out in this piece is amongst the AB deviliers , the Maxwells , the McCullums is that Afridi started power batting like that in the 90 's when the likes of McGrath , Warne , Ambrose , Walsh , Kumble , Sriniath , Vaas , Donald and Pollock were playing. The boundaries were long and did n't have the power play hoopla and you can keep more fielders outside the circle. Afridi was well and truly 15 years ahead of his time like mentioned here. Shane Warne once said in a commentary of a test match that his son 's favorite cricketer is Shahid Afridi. Kids growing all over the world back in late nineties and during the last decade can attest to that. Whether that kids be in Australia , England , India or Pakistan . ShahidAfridi.11 on April 6 , 2015 , 17 : 27 GMT Boom Boom... I sometimes wonder what is left in cricket after Afridi ! on April 6 , 2015 , 15 : 15 GMT @ Jaggi.Jagan If you compare stats of Kapil Dev with Afridi you wont find much difference in their average. Afridi was a bowling all-rounder who was inducted in the team because of his bowling and not batting . If Indians can consider their all-rounder a legend , let us Pakistanis be happy too calling him a game changer. . on April 6 , 2015 , 15 : 06 GMT Afridi played by his own book , a cricket text book which will never get published. He alone can attract a phrase like " prodigious prodigality " . In the context , Scott , no one would dare question this unusual usage { } : - ) LegSpinBowlr on April 6 , 2015 , 14 : 28 GMT I 'm pretty sure if Afridi was from any other country other than pakistan he would not have got so many chances for his team. Another player who reminds me of Afridi was Ricardo Powell on April 6 , 2015 , 14 : 02 GMT @ CHRIS PIKE ON APRIL 6 , 2015 , 8 : 33 GMT : Why ca n't these rich patrons adopt a few young talented English boys and see them through , till they start performing for England , proudly and productively . on April 6 , 2015 , 13 : 39 GMT Shahid BoomBoom Afridi : Quintesential Pakistani stroke player . As this article aptly put it , " Main man , cameo or no-show " . None could ever predict who will turn up . Adios , to one of the bet showman of this era . SillyPointEgg on April 6 , 2015 , 13 : 05 GMT Ah Afridi...The Brazil '82 World Cup Football team is the closest sporting comparison. Why play a forward defensive to a perfectly pitched 90mph outswinger when you have the gloriously delusional belief that your bat is the cricketing equivalent of Thor 's hammer. Socrates , Falcao , Zico , Junior...do n't need defenders mate. Hang on is that Paolo Rossi through on goal.... . The point is for all their flaws that Brazil '82 team is loved like no other. In 20 years time the legend of Afridi would have grown even more than it is now. I love players like Steve Waugh and Jacques Kaliis , defensive rocks , impeccable technicians. I love teams like AC Milan in the late 80 's early 90 's , success built on solid foundations and tactical rigour. But sometimes you need the human desire for freedom and creativity without boundaries reflected in the sporting arena . jb633 on April 6 , 2015 , 12 : 19 GMT @ ChrisPike , playing in that league myself I can tell you the answer. Rich old chairman with too much money and not enough other hobbies. I remember playing against Tino Best but the stories I could tell will not get published on here. Far more entertaining than Afrid 's anyway . on April 6 , 2015 , 11 : 45 GMT No doubt a great entertainer in the cricket history and perhaps his shots are now so much famous that pinch hitting in local language is called The AFRIDI batting . rambovicky on April 6 , 2015 , 11 : 38 GMT Shahid Afridi has been the most exciting and a very unique player. I agree that had he been more matured he would have scored many more runs and won more matches for his team , but then he would not be AFRIDI. A rare unique player who i think became a victim of Unreal expectations. He belongs to a warrior caste and always played like a warrior. Mohd. Yusuf recently criticized Afridi , i would like to ask him how many matches did u win , how many man of the matches did u win. I mean afridi is a decent all-rounder who has gor 32 man of the matches the highest for his country. There will be another sachin but I do n't think there will be another afridi . on April 6 , 2015 , 11 : 37 GMT Shahid Afridi was one of those cricketers who would always do something for his team either with his bat or bowling or fielding. When he was on the ground there was always a hope that he will do some miracle...Many people started watching cricket just because of him. Hope to see more from him in T20s . jaggi.jagan on April 6 , 2015 , 11 : 18 GMT Just 23 odd runs per game is the average runs scored playing nearly 400 one day games. Are you talking about the holder of this record as a Superstar ? on April 6 , 2015 , 10 : 57 GMT Always a heartthrob of millions of the cricket fans.. Lala the best entertainer in World cricket ... he was playing modern day fast cricket from the day he debut in 1996 at age of 26 year...... ( y ) on April 6 , 2015 , 10 : 06 GMT yes sir we miss boom boom afridi alot but we want to see him in different leagues on April 6 , 2015 , 9 : 20 GMT Reading all this , one feels that Pak did not utilise Afridi well over 18 yrs of International cricket. He should have opened the batting , would have been as devastating as Hayden or Sehwag. Probably more had he bided his time and his strokes. Later on his leg spinners would have added spice to a perennially strong Pak bowling attack. A batsman who could bowl would have been his ideal label and he should have played at least 80 tests . His overall numbers are disappointing.....neither commanding with bat or ball over 400 ODIs. But there is no denying his vast talent and range of skills shown. For me he will always remain a teen who smashed a 37 ball century at a time when it was unheard of . on April 6 , 2015 , 8 : 33 GMT what on earth are all these clubs doing splashing cash like nobody 's business ? and why are all these international players going there ? this is staffordshire and cheshire. you 'd think they 'd end up at clubs in surrey or sussex or yorkshire or something . on April 6 , 2015 , 8 : 11 GMT Super piece. Good writer meets good subject meets great context ! martinmoha on April 6 , 2015 , 7 : 41 GMT A Great Entertainer and nice human being AFRIDI a real hero for millions of cricket lovers all around the world.Infact was most Devastating batsman of all cricketing era but Unfortunately he had immense and impulsive desire to write the fate of every cricket ball out of the ground , if he had his cool than he would have break many world records , After Indian dominance in cricket in this decade and not given chance to play in IPL his talent and capabilities largely wasted . dunger.bob on April 6 , 2015 , 7 : 27 GMT What a great piece. This a story about putting a shark in the gold-fish pond. Fascinating in a macabre sort of way. I think Afridi was the proto-type T20 player. He was so forward thinking that he did n't even care that T20 did n't really even exist when he started playing it. So much so that he had to make do with playing his T20 in test matches. .. People will probably put him down with a barrage of stats but that means nothing to me. The very first time I saw him was in a ODI series in Australia in '96 and I vividly recall saying to the wife after about 2 games - " who 's afraid of Afridi ? .. I am ' . sajjadparrey on April 6 , 2015 , 6 : 31 GMT We might not see him on the international stage again....Why ? ... He is still the captain of T20 Team.. . on April 6 , 2015 , 6 : 07 GMT well elaborated and equally remarkably written sir on April 6 , 2015 , 6 : 00 GMT Beautiful piece of writing. Hits the important parts Afridi 's personality yet again. Afridi started playing that way before it was a norm like these days. He has the ability to give his fans ecstasy and heartbreaks every time he came out to bat. Hope he breaks a couple of records in his remaining T20 career . Arun_Gally_Cricket on April 6 , 2015 , 5 : 48 GMT A Great Talent , who could have achieved more than he did. He just lived in hype dream. A sad end in deed . KiwiRocker- on April 6 , 2015 , 5 : 21 GMT Scott : Just a correction , Afridi has not retired from International cricket and instead from ODI format. He is still Pakistan 's T20 captain. Nicely written piece with some good humour. One of the best innings , I ever saw from Afridi was his 40 odd ball century against India as an opener in Kanpur. This was no ordinary Indian bowling and had likes of nice seam bowlers Balaji , and spinners Kumble and Harbhajan......My other memory would be Afridi 's five sixes in an over against Harbhajan.
