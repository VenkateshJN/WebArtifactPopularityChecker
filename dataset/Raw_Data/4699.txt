Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 " It 's been one hell of a ride for us , right the way through , we played some outstanding cricket , " he said at the presentation . " We ran into an outstanding team in Australia , they continue to set the standard... they deserved to win. " New Zealand 's hopes of pulling off an upset suffered a devastating blow when McCullum was clean bowled by Mitchell Starc in the first over of the day . They recovered with a brilliant 83 from Grant Elliott and a dour 40 from Ross Taylor but lost their last seven wickets for 33 runs to be all out for 183 in 45 overs . " It probably did n't unfold as planned , but we got ourselves back in the game at 3 for 150 , " McCullum said . " With 180 , you still dare to dream and it could have ended up differently with a couple of things going our way. " For New Zealand , the tournament was still a great success. They had never played in a World Cup final before , reaching the semi-finals six times but losing on each occasion , and were unbeaten going into the final . " This is what you ask for as a cricketer , " McCullum said . " We 've forged memories and friendships that will last forever. We did n't lift the trophy but we have no regrets with the brand of cricket we 've played . " We walk away with our heads held high. It 's the greatest time of our lives and that 's how we tried to play the game , with a free spirit and heart. I think we can be very proud of our achievements in this tournament.
