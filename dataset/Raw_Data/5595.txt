" The player in question has been told to maintain the dignity of the Indian team at all times , and avoid any such behaviour in the future. The BCCI would like to request the concerned parties to move on , and focus on the Indian cricket team 's campaign in the ongoing ICC CWC 2015 , " stated the BCCI release . The release also added : " The BCCI has been in touch with the Indian team management on this issue , and has advised that this kind of incident should not be repeated . " The BCCI respects the role played by the media in covering and popularizing the game of cricket , and acknowledges the support of the media , in its mission to administer and promote the game of cricket in India. " Kohli 's emotions had come to a boil at the scenic Murdoch University ground on Tuesday after the teams train session had ended. Before heading towards the nets , the Indian vice-captain confronted a journalist and went on an expletive-filled tirade in full public view . It later turned out that Kohli had intended it for a different journalist. He then apologized through another journalist and the team management chose to play down the incident as a case of 'misunderstanding'.The incident was however reported to the ICC and BCCI . © Cricbuzz Tags
