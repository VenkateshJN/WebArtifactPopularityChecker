1 ( 2w ) 6.6 to Samuels , 123.0 kph , cutter , coming back at Samuels , who steers the ball straight to point ! Wiese charges off in celebration , that 's a big wicket and an excellent over. Samuels tried to make room to go inside out but mistimed the shot , a thickish outside edge flew to Ontong on the edge of the ring 60/2 8.4 to Simmons , 122.6 kph , comes forward again , hits through the line... but it 's not going to clear long-on ! Simmons misses out on a half-century and South Africa tighten their grip. Cleared the front leg and was looking to hit this into the crowd but Wiese had bowled a leg cutter , it held up a bit and flew straight to the fielder on the rope 68/3 12.2 to Bravo , 114.2 kph , top-edged hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigggghhhh into the sky , Wiese has another ! Bravo was trying to hammer this over the leg side but was done by the lack of pace , hand came off the bat and the ball spiralled up and down into the waiting gloves of van Wyk , who had jogged over to backward square leg 84/5 16.3 to Sammy , 116.8 kph , tries to cut but it 's too close , top-edged to backward point ! That 's pretty much a wrap , Wiese has his fourth wicket , best bowling in T20Is. Had to manufacture the power , again the cutter coming back in , miscued to the edge of the circle 114/7 16.6 to Brathwaite , 115.1 kph , length ball on the stumps , Brathwaite spanks it straight to deep midwicket ! That 's five for Wiese... They 've been trying to hit the cover off him all night but still West Indies are none the Wiese 116/8
