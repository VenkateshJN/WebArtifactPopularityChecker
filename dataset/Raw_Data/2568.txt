( Reuters Photo ) Page 1 of 4 SOUTHAMPTON : The International Cricket Council ( ICC ) confirmed on Wednesday that it had received legal submissions from the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) and had accepted Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja 's request for an appeal against Match Referee David Boon 's decision to fine the player 50 per cent of his match fee after finding him guilty of an offence under Article 2.1.8 of the Code of Conduct . The appeal will be heard at the same time as the disciplinary hearing that takes place in respect of the charge against James Anderson on Friday in Southampton . ICC Appeals Commissioner Gordon Lewis will oversee proceedings. It may be recalled that Jadeja and England pacer Jimmy Anderson were involved in a spat during the first Test at Trent Bridge , following which the Indian team management had accused the latter of a Level 3 offence. The England team had filed a counter Level 2 charge against Jadeja . Pankaj 's dubious record India seamer Pankaj Singh became the owner on Wednesday of a record he would rather not have broken when he recorded the most expensive match figures by a Test debutant without a wicket . The 29-year-old 6ft 6 inches tall paceman finished with a match haul of none for 179 in the third Test at Southampton . That saw Singh surpass the previous worst wicketless debut return of none for 164 by Pakistan 's Sohail Khan against Sri Lanka in Karachi in 2009 .
