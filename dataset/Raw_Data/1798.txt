Break has rejuvenated the team : Dhoni The author has posted comments on this article Santosh Suri , TNN | Feb 8 , 2015 , 11.34AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 ADELAIDE : On the eve of India 's first warm-up game against Australia here , India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni stressed that the break taken by the Indian team " has been very useful " and has rejuvenated the team . " The team definitely felt the workload playing the Test matches and then the tri-series. This break has helped us to recharge our batteries. Now , we will use the two warm-up games to settle the playing XI that will feature in the first ( World Cup ) game. The warm-ups will be crucial from the perspective of what we want to achieve out of it. " On the upcoming India-Pakistan clash , Dhoni said : " A lot of people have different views about the India-Pakistan matches. How I personally take it is similar to playing Australia , SL or any other Test-playing nation. The moment you start thinking about a rivalry , you are just going to be adding pressure to yourself. " India 's build-up to the World Cup has not been ideal. They lost the Test series against Australia and failed to register a win in the tri-series. But the captain is not worried. " Even while playing the Champions Trophy , we were going through a rough patch. But the guys stepped up during that tournament and we played very consistently to emerge champions . " In this World Cup , most of the teams are quite balanced. It will be a very special World Cup for all the teams. It will be a matter of which team is more consistent and what kind of momentum it takes with it into the knockout stages. If you see the past , there have been a few teams that do really well in ICC tournaments but may not be the best of teams when it comes to bilateral series. They have always stepped up when it comes to an ICC tournament. " Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
