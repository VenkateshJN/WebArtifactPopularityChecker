Loading comments sundar02 on March 23 , 2015 , 21 : 58 GMT Stat are always misleading. Pool of left handlers are hight quality ( in fact only 6 or 7 ) compare to right arm bowlers which is mixed by ordinary bowlers ( about 40 players ) . Its all about who is the bowler than which hand they use. It does not matter about arm , parnell despite left arm , he is bad , on the other hand styn , abott , sami and hazelwood are very best. Do n't do too much fuzz about left armers . Popular Videos
