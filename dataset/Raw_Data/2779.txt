Injuries , fielding hurt Lanka 's chances in World Cup : Mathews The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Mar 27 , 2015 , 08.55PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 COLOMBO : A combination of poor fielding and regularly losing players through injuries has hurt Sri Lanka 's chances in the cricket World Cup , captain Angelo Mathews said on Friday . " Our fielding levels dropped , " Mathews said , adding that losing as many as five players from the original squad of 15 left the team unbalanced . Sri Lanka lost fast bowler Dhammika Prasad , opening batsman Dimuth Karunaratne , main spin bowler Rangana Herath , all-rounder Jeewan Mendis and middle-order batsman Dinesh Chandimal at various stages of the tournament . Mathews defended the decision to make key changes in the quarterfinal against South Africa , which they lost by nine wickets. Tharindu Kaushal , a young off-spinner was given his ODI debut while Kusal Janith Perera was drafted to open innings after coming into the side as a replacement . " Kaushal is an attacking bowler and we wanted to make use of the fact that he had not been seen before , " Mathews said . Sri Lanka 's campaign ended with the 9-wicket defeat to South Africa and it was the first time since 1999 that they failed to reach the semifinal stage. They were runners up in both 2007 and 2011 . Chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya said in future Sri Lanka would deploy a very tight physical fitness regime for the national squad . " We will take a very closer look at fitness levels of players beginning from the Sri Lanka A squad , " Jayasuriya said . Coach Marvan Atapattu defended himself against criticism in his role . " If we did not lose to Australia we would have finished second in our group , then we would not have faced South Africa , " Atapattu said .
