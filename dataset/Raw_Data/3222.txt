( AP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 ADELAIDE : India lost two wickets but were resisting Australia 's bowlers well on the final day of the opening Adelaide Test on Saturday . Faced with an improbable 364 winning target off a minimum 98 overs after Australia declared on their overnight score of 290/5 , the tourists were 105/2 at lunch . Opener Murali Vijay was unbeaten on 47 with skipper Virat Kohli not out 25 . In hot sunny conditions , the Indians lost the wickets of Shikhar Dhawan and Cheteshwar Pujara in the extended morning session , but Vijay and Kohli safely got their team through to lunch . India face an against-the-odds target with no team scoring more than 315 to win a Test match at the Adelaide Oval since Australia overhauled England at the ground in 1902 . Dhawan appeared to get a bad call by umpire Ian Gould when he was given out caught behind off a Mitchell Johnson bouncer for nine in the day 's fifth over . Replays indicated that the ball came off Dhawan 's shoulder and not glove as wicketkeeper Brad Haddin took an athletic catch down the leg-side . Vijay survived a big shout on 24 for leg before wicket going back on his stumps off Lyon . Umpire Marais Erasmus turned down Lyon 's vociferous appeal and replays showed the ball would have hit the stumps . Pujara was done by one that Lyon straightened and he edged to Haddin for 21 in the 20th over leaving the tourists at 57 for two . Lyon had taken one for 48 off 12 overs at lunch .
