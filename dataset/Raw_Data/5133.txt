Imposter posing as former Pakistan cricketer embarrasses BBC Imposter posing as former Pakistan cricketer embarrasses BBC 2015/Mar/14 12 : 19 : 00 Text Size It 's difficult to believe but it 's a true story. A certain Nadeem Alam from Manchester conned the BBC into believing that he was former Pakistan cricketer Nadeem Abbasi and did a few shows for BBC World News , BBC Asian Network and Radio Five Live until the discovery of his real identity. Apparently , he was also part of a discussion that involved former India Test opener Aakash Chopra . Abbasi , who played three Test matches and scored 46 runs in all for Pakistan way back in 1989 , showed his displeasure at the situation and took a dig at the corporation for not doing its research properly . " If I ever find Nadeem Alam , I will punch him in the face for damaging the country 's reputation , " he told the Sun . The 46-year-old , who is presently doing a coaching job in Rawalpindi , added : " The BBC is a big institution and surely they must check ? " The BBC , in its reply , apologised to the former Pakistan batsman. A BBC spokesman said : " We apologise to the real Mr Abbasi and we will be looking seriously into what has happened. " In a brief chat to the Sun , Alam sounded light-hearted and unapologetic. " I like to think I have been talking good cricket , " he said . Â© Cricbuzz ( with inputs from agencies )
