No promise of World Cup win bonus for Proteas The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Feb 8 , 2015 , 04.16PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 JOHANNESBURG : The South Africa cricket team left home this week buoyant after their win over visiting West Indies and a send-off by thousands of fans , but there will be no special bonus for them if they return with the World Cup trophy from Australia and New Zealand . Cricket South Africa chief executive Haroon Lorgat told the Afrikaans daily 'Beeld ' that there was no plan for any incentive bonus for winning the tournament beginning on February 14. " Should the Proteas come through the group phase undefeated and eventually be crowned world champions , they will earn in the region of USD 4 million in prize money , " Lorgat said . " That is not an unreasonable amount to earn , ( but ) we feel that the pride of playing for your country in the World Cup and becoming the first South African players to hold up high the trophy should be enough motivation for the players , rather than trying to motivate them with bonuses as well , " he said . But Lorgat did not completely rule out the possibility of any additional payment to AB de Villiers and his men if they returned triumphant. He conceded that a year ago he would not have been as confident as he was now of his country being crowned victors . " If you asked me 12 months ago , I would probably not have been so full of confidence , but I am convinced after the performances delivered in the past year and how the team has grown. There is no reason not to believe that the Proteas can become the champions . " The ball is now in the hands of AB and his players to accomplish the task and be successful. This team should however not doubt at all that it has the support of every citizen ( of South Africa ) , " said Lorgat .
