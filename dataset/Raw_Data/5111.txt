Saeed Ajmal 's action cleared by ICC 2015/Feb/07 01 : 32 : 00 Text Size © AFP Pakistan offspinner Saeed Ajmal received a huge boost as his action was cleared by International Cricket Council ( ICC ) , giving him the go-ahead to bowl in international cricket. ICC also cleared the action of Bangladesh 's Sohag Gazi. The development could see the top-ranked bowler in the world play at the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 . ICC confirmed that all the deliveries that were bowled by the duo during the official test at the Sri Ramachandra University in Chennai on 24 January were within the permitted 15-degree level of elbow extension. Video footage and images of the pair 's remodelled actions have been sent across to umpires all over the world. ICC described their reworked actions as " significantly remodelled legal bowling actions " . " Following remedial work and retests , the bowling actions of Pakistan 's Saeed Ajmal and Sohag Gazi of Bangladesh had been found to be legal , and the players could now resume bowling in international cricket , " ICC said through a media release . In September last year , ICC had confirmed that an independent analysis had found the bowling action of Saeed Ajmal to be illegal , and placed him under suspension from bowling in international cricket with immediate effect. The apex body had also added that the independent analysis found that all his ( Ajmal ) deliveries exceeded the 15-degree limit of tolerance permitted under the regulations . In December , the 37-year-old withdrew himself from the World Cup after failing to rectify his action in time to be eligible for selection . Now , however , Ajmal has found himself with a chance at the last moment to make his appearance at the World Cup in Australia in New Zealand. With the final squads having already been submitted , Pakistan , or Bangladesh , would not be permitted to draft in any new player unless someone from the squad has to be removed due to injury or personal reasons . © Cricbuzz
