'I have a mean cover drive' Tennis ace Leander Paes talks Sunny , Viv , Sachin and Kallis March 2015 © Getty Images What is the best cricket match you have watched ? As a kid back in Calcutta , I would be glued to the television , and one of my fondest memories is India prevailing over the rest of the world , watching Kapil Dev and Sunny Gavaskar lift the 1983 World Cup . What can tennis learn from cricket ? Cricket has done such a fantastic job in terms of governance of the sport and also the way they look after their athletes - getting a game played in three different formats to integrate itself into the mindset of such a large population. So tennis on a global scale can learn from cricket in terms of the marketing and positioning of the sport . Who was your cricket hero growing up ? Viv Richards was one of my favourites. Sunny Gavaskar is a true gentleman. I loved the way Sachin conducted himself . Have you got any compliments from cricketers ? Sunny Gavaskar keeps calling me " Viv " because apparently I remind him of Viv Richards. I hope it 's because of the way I hit my forehands and my serves . Who 's your favourite international cricket player ? Virat Kohli. He is quite a vibrant brand. He can be a good ambassador and role model for youngsters in our country . What 's your favourite cricket shot to play ? I have a mean cover drive. I have a good pair of hands. I see the ball quick. I love playing cricket - it 's one of my favourite things . A bowler you would like to face ? The whole West Indies fast bowling attack of yesteryear . Which modern cricketer do you think could make a good tennis player ? Jacques Kallis is a mean tennis player. He is one of the top athletes. And Sachin is good too . As told to Gaurav Kalra , senior editor at ESPNcricinfo © ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
