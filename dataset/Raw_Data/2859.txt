Surgery is now the word for Harris The author has posted comments on this article Dwaipayan Datta , TNN | Feb 22 , 2015 , 12.06PM IST Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 Harris , who was at the Hagley Oval on Saturday for the Pakistan West Indies game , had his share of injuries and operations during his playing days. But these days , his job keeps him in the operation theatre. He works for Orthotech , a company that sells products to neuro and orthopedic surgeons across Australia and New Zealand . " I have to be in the operation theatre to see how the products that we sell are working. It feels so far away from the playing arena , where I spent so many years , " Harris said . The all-rounder said that he had three operations in his playing years. " Those days when I went in for the operation , there would be a sense of worry. These days , as I see it from close , I feel it 's part and parcel of life. " Harris is also one of the ambassadors for the World Cup. He feels New Zealand and Australia are the favourites , but does n't rule out India. He had a batting average of 29 and he sees shades of himself in Stuart Binny . " I have played with Stuart in the ICL and he can be a matchwinner. India should have faith in him and play him , " Harris said . He feels Martin Guptill will be adjudged the best fielder. " It 's between Guptill , Brendon McCullum and AB de Villiers. But I think Guptill is the best of the lot , " Harris added .
