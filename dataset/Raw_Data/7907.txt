Here are the numbers that mattered in Hamilton : 256 – David Miller and JP Duminy ’ s fifth-wicket partnership was not only a World Record , it also completely changed the tone of the match . South Africa ’ s situation was starting to look dire at 84-4 before the pair took control , smashing their way to an unbeaten 256-run stand .

Despite falling 62 runs shy of victory , Zimbabwe smashed 28 fours and seven sixes , including an enormous six from Solomon Mire which saw the ball go flying out of Seddon Oval . The Proteas gave fans plenty of opportunities to Catch a Million themselves , sending 14 deliveries clear over the boundary . 30 – The 48th over belong to David Miller , who smashed 30 runs off the bowling of Solomon Mire . He started with a massive six and followed with 4 , 4 , 6 , 4 and 6 . He became the eighth batsman to score 30 off an over in the process , joining AB de Villiers , Mark Boucher and Jacques Kallis , fellow South Africans to have achieved the feat . 4 – He only scored 25 with the bat but AB de Villiers put on a clinic in the field , taking three catches and effecting a run out – the first player to do so in a World Cup match . His diving effort to remove Solomon Mire in the deep was particularly impressive . To see the match report of this match , please click here . Share this article :
