FEATURED 0 POSTED BY aqua_omer on | March 2 , 2015 , 21 : 59 GMT Lara and Waqar are both my favorite players so hard to say who performed better against each other when they were neck in neck.I 'd pay any day of the week to watch either of them. But I 'll have to say that Lara did n't score a hundred in 7 tests that he played against Pak with Wasim and Waqar in the attack so maybe he did n't have the best outing against them. Having said that , Lara did destroy them in ODI 's but you ca n't really compare ODI 's in 90 's with no bouncers allowed to test cricket .

Lmao . POSTED BY shaidy1 on | March 2 , 2015 , 14 : 22 GMT Good read. Lara and Waqar legends in their own right. Lara , infact tore most bowling attacks but probably received the best yorker via Waqar younis that felled him to the ground. Part and parcel of the game. As for Usain , would have been great to see him as a fast bowler , as someone stated earlier in the Michael Holding mould ! POSTED BY HawksEyeFocused on | March 2 , 2015 , 7 : 08 GMT WoW.......He 's ideal bowler is Waqar Younis ! ! ! Proud to be Pakistani ! ! ! : ) POSTED BY truthfinder on | March 2 , 2015 , 3 : 05 GMT Usain Bolt himself is a classical example of decline of WI cricket. In earlier days the athlete with his talent and physicality would always join cricket to enrich the bottomless supply of fast bowling pool. But in current situation even Holding , Walsh would have become sprinters , Ambrose would have been basket baller and Loyd & Richards would have been lecturers in colleges. The main point is Caribbean youngsters lost interest in cricket. The neglect and ignorance by financial groups made cricket as a profession not worthy as it is in India , England or Australia. The cricket world must do something to drag the genuine African muscles and abilities ( that WI represents ) to the cricket field by making the profession more financially viable . POSTED BY Ahadd Ali on | March 1 , 2015 , 22 : 44 GMT I believe that Usain would have been a great fast bowler in the mold of Michael Holding. His run up speed would have terrified many batsmen and he would generated real pace . POSTED BY kentjones on | March 1 , 2015 , 21 : 54 GMT Hail Usain Bolt , one of the greatest athlete of all time. Looking forward to your exploits in the upcoming Olympics my friend . POSTED BY wapuser on | March 1 , 2015 , 19 : 39 GMT Usain bolt is the greatest athlete of his era.he knows the greats better . POSTED BY EZEKEL on | March 1 , 2015 , 18 : 26 GMT A very good interview. It provides good information and direction POSTED BY dchadee on | March 1 , 2015 , 16 : 44 GMT can someone post lara and hooper u19 starts for tt and guy POSTED BY akmalkakar on | March 1 , 2015 , 13 : 48 GMT @ RICKOSHAY I did n't lose respect for Lara nor did I stop admiring him when he fell on the ground after being hit at the back of the neck by a Shaoib Akhtar bouncer. Similarly , Usain did n't stop admiring Waqar when Lara made runs against him . POSTED BY akmalkakar on | March 1 , 2015 , 13 : 44 GMT @ people Well , I think both Lara and Waqar were greats in their own capacity , I mean you can not compare Waqar , one of the great bolwers of his time and Lara , one of the great batsmen of his era. Comparing them would do injustice to what both of them have achieved individually. Usain recognizes both of them for what they were and he did n't need to stop admiring Waqar when Lara made runs against him . POSTED BY swarzi on | March 1 , 2015 , 12 : 45 GMT @ RICKOSHAY ON , Usain knew that Lara tore ANY BOWLER apart ANYTIME , so he had no reason to cheer for either of them. I was a fan of the Pakistani duo ( Akram and Younis ) myself ; but I liked how Carl Hooper made batting look easy. However , it was when Lara made his first tour to SA in 1993 ; and the domineering way that he tore into Akram and Waqar on those pacey and bouncy wickets ( scoring a MoM 128 ) made me pay more attention to him. Then in the next match , he similarly decimated Allan Donald and Co. for a 2nd consecutive Mom 100 - it was amazing to see how he ADAPTED so quickly to the SA conditions. Then by his consistent domineering exploits against any bowler , with those LIGHT 'PITCHPINE ' BATS , he compelled the entire world to respect him as the best of his time. Similarly , De Villiers is forcing the world now to rate him as the best of his time. I do n't how to rate De Villiers vs Lara , because while AB is being aided and abetted by his BIG BAT etc , Lara never had that luxury . POSTED BY RickOShay on | March 1 , 2015 , 11 : 04 GMT Who were you cheering for when Lara was tearing Waqar apart in Sharjah en route to 153 ? POSTED BY Syed Arbab on | February 17 , 2015 , 6 : 02 GMT Proud moment for Pakistan , I wish to see him meeting with Waqar younus in a TV program .
