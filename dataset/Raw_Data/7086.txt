3.80 ( 1nb ) 20.3 to Usman Ghani , ha ha , what a dismissal that is ! Goes for a big hit and does n't quite judge the length right. Ball turns and he sends it soaring high in the air over the on side. Dhawan , running back from short midwicket , and Umesh , running in from long-on , converge on the ball. Dhawan is quicker to it , dives , gets it in his grasp , but spills it when his elbows hit the ground. Then he manages to juggle it while sliding forward , once , twice , and then into Umesh 's waiting hands. Brilliant work there from Dhawan. 93/2 39.4 to Mohammad Nabi , boom. Down the track , looks to hit inside out , misses , and when the batsmen miss , Jadeja usually hits 169/6
