Payback time for Kolkata Knight Riders ' favourite son Yusuf Pathan Amitava Das Gupta Amitava Das Gupta,TNN | May 26 , 2014 , 10.03 AM IST Yusuf has been the biggest underperformer over the last four seasons. ( PTI Photo ) RELATED KOLKATA : Here 's one for the quiz master 's notebook : Who was the only bowler to have delivered a dot ball to Yusuf Pathan on the night of May 24 , 2014 , when the Baroda Bomber tore Sunrisers Hyderabad to shreds at the Eden and propelled Kolkata Knight Riders past Chennai Super Kings into second place in IPL 7 ? Karn Sharma won that consolation prize , as Yusuf missed an attempted whip one to the leg side. The young leggie , who had Yusuf dropped by Anirudh Srikkanth off the first ball he faced , ultimately picked up his wicket. But , by that time , the damage had been done . It 's been a season when T20 lovers have been treated to some mind-boggling power-hitting. Whirlwind half-centuries by David Miller ( 19-ball 51 * against RR and 29-ball 66 vs RCB ) , Glenn Maxwell ( 38-ball 90 vs CSK and a couple of 43ball 95s ) and Yuvraj Singh ( 29-ball 68 * vs RCB ) readily come to mind. But nothing can match Yusuf 's carnage ( 22-ball 72 ) when KKR were trying to chase 161 in just 15.2 overs . It all seemed like child 's play for Yusuf as he smashed 7 sixes , 5 fours , ran 6 singles and took 2 twos besides playing that solitary dot ball to race to his fifty in a record 15 balls and whip up an unbelievable strike rate of 327.27 ! His knock can be crunched into three back-to-back overs - the 11th of the innings in which he took 21 off Parvez Rasool ( 2x6 , 2x4 ) , the 12th in which he scored 15 off Karn Sharma ( 2x6 ) and , most significantly , the 13th when he pounced on a dumbstruck Dale Steyn to plunder 26 ( 3x4 , 2x6 ) . " I did not think much , we just had to score 80-odd runs from 36 balls to finish second... So we needed about 12-15 runs an over to take the game forward , " was Yusuf 's uncomplicated explanation. " The only thing going on in my mind was to hit the ball that comes in the area , " he added . Sunrisers Hyderabad coach Tom Moody saluted Yusuf while ruing the missed chances. " You can not give a player like Yusuf two chances. We have only ourselves to blame , " said the Australian before adding : " He 's a very good hitter. No ground is big enough to stop him. " For a man who hit a 37-ball hundred for Rajasthan Royals in 2010 and was bought by KKR for a whopping $ 2.1 million ( Rs 10.5 crore ) in the 2011 IPL players ' auction , Yusuf has been the biggest underperformer over the last four seasons . The fact that the Baroda right-hander had scored just one half-century in 52 innings in KKR colours before Saturday 's blitzkrieg , tells its own story . And yet , the KKR team management kept backing him to the hilt , retaining him for Rs 3.25 crore by playing the right-to-match card at the 2014 auction . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Yuvraj Singh,Yusuf Pathan,Sunrisers Hyderabad,Kolkata Knight Riders,Dale Steyn Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
