Srinivasan ca n't attend ICC meetings : Abdi The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Apr 1 , 2014 , 03.06PM IST Abdi has also filed an FIR against Srinivasan alleging fixing in a IPL match featuring Chennai Super Kings , owned by the BCCI chief 's company India Cements. ( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 JAIPUR : Rajasthan Cricket Association 's representative in the BCCI , Mehmood Abdi , on Tuesday said that N Srinivasan is not eligible to represent the body in the ICC after being forced to step aside due to a Supreme Court directive . Srinivasan has been replaced by Sunil Gavaskar as the interim BCCI chief after the Supreme Court directed the Chennai strongman to step aside while hearing the case related to the IPL betting scandal . Abdi has also filed an FIR against Srinivasan alleging fixing in a IPL match featuring Chennai Super Kings , owned by the BCCI chief 's company India Cements. The top court has asked for the removal of all India Cements employees from the BCCI . " Removal of smaller functionaries of India Cements from various BCCI assignments would not be the desired compliance of the Supreme Court Order until N Srinivasan is removed from all BCCI assignments and responsibilities including representation in ICC , " Abdi , who is also a counsel for Srinivasan 's foe and former IPL commissioner Lalit Modi , said in a statement . " In view of this clear direction of the honourable apex court , N Srinivasan can not represent BCCI at the ICC since he being an India Cements employee is barred by the Supreme Court order to be associated with any assignment of duties by the BCCI . " This clarification on part of the interim president of the BCCI is imperative since an impression is being created in a section of media that Srinivasan 's role as the BCCI 's representative in the ICC is still intact , " he added .
