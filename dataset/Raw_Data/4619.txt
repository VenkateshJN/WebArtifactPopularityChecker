READ MORE : Virat Kohli seeks SCG inspiration for semifinal " I heard Davy said he was n't going to get involved in all that stuff , " paceman Johnson told Fox TV on Tuesday . " Someone 's got to do it and I might put my hand up. It 's part of the game and what happened the other day with Shane ( Watson ) and Wahab ( Riaz ) was exceptional . " I thought it was great entertainment and I think you 're going to see more entertainment in this game. " Watson had the last laugh on Pakistan paceman Wahab after their compelling duel in the quarterfinals last week when he helped steer Australia to victory. Both players were later fined . Johnson has some history with India in the sledging stakes and made them pay for having the temerity to lampoon him after he went wicket-less in the first innings of the second test at the Gabba last December . The 33-year-old slugged 88 off 93 balls to help rescue Australia 's first innings and then took three wickets in a dazzling spell of bowling and finished with figures of 4-61 as Australia won the match by four wickets . " I love it. The more that comes my way , the better , " he said at the time . As well as Warner , Indians Shikhar Dhawan , Ishant Sharma and Virat Kohli were fined for clashes during the Test series .
