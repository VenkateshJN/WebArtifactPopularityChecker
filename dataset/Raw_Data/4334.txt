( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 After winning seven games in a row , defending champions India fell to a superior Australia. Overall though , it was a praiseworthy performance by a team which was n't rated too highly after a lacklustre run going into the tournament. TOI presents Team India 's World Cup report card.. . Full coverage : ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 MS DHONI 6/10 : His Test retirement just before the World Cup had left his critics wondering whether he would retain his mojo in One-day cricket , but 'Captain Cool ' was his usual self , shepherding the team to the semis without a glitch. Against the Aussies at Sydney , though , his captaincy left something to be desired , like the delay in bringing R Ashwin into the attack. As a batsman , Dhoni had a decent outing , guiding his men through a couple of tense chases. M 8 , R 237 , Avg 59.25 , HS 85 * , SR 102.15 VIRAT KOHLI 4/10 : His average of 50.83 in WC is misleading because , apart from scoring a hundred against Pakistan in the opener , India 's best batsman just did not join the party. His failure was one of the big disappointments of the tournament from India 's point of view. He played poor strokes in both the knockout games to get out cheaply. Had a forgettable semifinal , where he also dropped a catch. To make it worse , got into a needless controversy by allegedly abusing a journalist. M 8 , R 305 , Avg 50.83 , HS 107 , SR 81.55 ROHIT SHARMA 6/10 : Virat Kohli had called him India 's 'X factor ' in the World Cup. Unfortunately for the Men in Blue , the 'X factor ' worked only once , sending India into the semifinals with a classy century in the last-eight clash against Bangladesh. Sharma would look back at this World Cup and say he could have done much better. All that he had to show in the league stage was a couple of half-centuries against minnows. Inconsistency , yet again , was his bane. M 8 , R 330 , Avg 47.14 , HS 137 , SR 91.66 SHIKHAR DHAWAN 8/10 : The opener bounced back brilliantly from a horrible run to end up as the highest run-getter for India in the World Cups abilities. Dhawan played some cracking knocks to give the Indian campaign big impetus. The left-hander 's only blemish , perhaps , was playing one stroke too many in the semis just as he was looking good. It allowed the Aussies a foot into the door. M 8 , R 412 , Avg 51.50 , HS 110 * , SR 91.75 SURESH RAINA 6/10 : Produced a few sparkling knocks , but his cheap dismissal against Australia while trying to cut a ball means that question marks would continue to be raised against Raina 's ability to deliver outside Asia against quality teams. Still , his efforts against Pakistan ( 74 , 56 balls ) , Zimbabwe ( 110 n.o. , 104 balls ) and Bangladesh ( 65 , 57 balls ) deserve praise. Did well with his part-time off spin to slow down Ireland 's charge at Hamilton. M 8 , R 284 , Avg 56.80 , HS 107 , SR 110.07 AJINKYA RAHANE 4/10 : His cracking of 79 off 60 balls against SA , where he smashed the pacers to all parts of the MCG , promised much , but Rahane went off the boil after that. His laboured to 44 off 68 balls in the semis when the situation demanded more urgency. Had a golden opportunity to seal the No. 4 spot in the ODI team , but squandered it. M 8 , R 208 , Avg : 34.66 , HS : 79 , SR : 82.53 R ASHWIN 8/10 : Was arguably the best spinner of show. Bowling much slower through the air , flighting the ball and sticking to conventional off-spin rather than trying out too many variations , Ashwin was a revelation. Even as the Aussies took the others to the cleaners at Sydney , Ashwin was the standout bowler , winning his duel with the dangerous Maxwell. Bowling economically and picking up wickets as well , he has proved it that he can be effective outside India as well , at least in the ODIs. M 8 , W 13 , Avg 25.38 , BB 4-25 , Eco 4.28 RAVINDRA JADEJA 3/10 : Apart from fielding well and coming up with a stylish haircut , with a beard and moustache to boot , 'Sir Jadeja ' did little else of note. He was inconsistent with the ball and ineffective with the bat. At No. 7 , he never provided any assurance. In no game did he pick up more than two wickets. M 8 , W 9 , Avg 39.66 , BB 2-23 , Eco 5.35 , Runs 57 , Avg 14.25 , HS : 23 * UMESH YADAV 7.5/10 : Recovered from an ordinary Test series Down Under to put in a surprisingly fabulous performance , bowling fiery spells to rattle the opposition. His twin strikes in one over swung the game against Pakistan decisively in India 's favour. Slipped into the bad habit of bowling short in the semis at times , letting Steve Smith go after him with four fours in one over , but kept coming back spiritedly. With 18 scalps , Yadav is at No. 3 in the list of top-wicket takers of WC. M 8 , W 18 , Avg 17.83 , BB 4-31 , Eco 4.98 MOHAMMED SHAMI 7.5/10 : Had a bad game in the semis , but his overall effort was commendable. Like Yadav , Shami discovered the right line and length to bowl in Australia to deliver a telling performance. Combined well with Yadav as both pushed the batsmen on the back foot with their impressive pace and clever use of the short delivery. Sadly for India , he had an off day when it mattered the most. M 7 , W 17 , Avg 17.29 , BB 4-35 , Eco 4.81 MOHIT SHARMA 7/10 : Nobody expected this medium-pacer to set the Yarra on fire , but Mohit put in a decent show to justify his last-minute inclusion. He was the ideal foil to Yadav and Shami , outfoxing the batsmen with his variations. He was the hero of India 's win over the Proteas when he dismissed Amla before running De Villiers out with a brilliant throw. Unfortunately , Mohit too floundered against the Aussies.
