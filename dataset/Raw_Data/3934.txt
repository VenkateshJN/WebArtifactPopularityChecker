Riaz delivered one of the most memorable and fierce fast bowling spells against Australia in the lost quarterfinal . " What I saw of him against Australia convinces me that he 's got it in him to make it big as a leader because he showed aggression , passion and emotion and that is what is required right now to put Pakistan cricket back on track . " The team think tank have not really been able to give Pakistan that aggressive tag that its renowned for and I 've been very disappointed with the route that we have taken. Pakistan cricket is about emotion , about showing passion and to a certain degree about being unpredictable in a healthy way , which makes it so romantic , " Raja said . Wahab was standout performers for Pakistan in the World Cup as he finished with 16 scalps . Raja said it would not a be a bad idea if Riaz is given the leadership role . " You can experiment with an out-of-box idea like this in one-day cricket. Australia is a great example. George Bailey was plucked out of first class cricket straight into international cricket as a leader when he was made T20 captain , " he said . " I 've seen the ingredients to give Wahab Riaz that pedestal and position. Let 's see how he operates but what I saw of him against Australia , he can take Pakistan cricket in the right direction , " Raja said in an interview .
