( TOI Photo ) RELATED NEW DELHI : The TV umpire 's role in assisting their on-field counterparts has increased rapidly with the advent of T20 , with almost every run-out being checked for legality by the third umpire . But Daredevils skipper Kevin Pietersen benefitted from onfield umpire Sanjay Hazare 's reluctance to consult the TV cameras when the batsman was clearly run out . In the seventh over of the game , Pietersen mistimed a whip off his leg as wicketkeeper Sanju Samson swiftly threw down the stumps but Hazare turned down the appeal for run-out . The replays on the giant screen at Kotla clearly showed Pietersen short of his ground and an irate Royals skipper Shane Watson went to argue his case with umpire Hazare , but to no avail. Thankfully for the Royals , the reprieve did n't cost much as KP holed out down the ground a few minutes later . FIRE SCARE AT THE KOTLA : The Daredevils might have been losing on the field but the Kotla was not without its share of excitement. With three overs left in the game , smoke started bellowing out from the Super Hospitality Hill 'A ' section due to a fire in the kitchen situated in the area. The fire was controlled within a few minutes but the smoke filtered on to the field for a while . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Shane Watson,Sanju Samson,Sanjay Hazare,Kevin Pietersen Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
