Broad removed Gautam Gambhir ( 4 ) when he edged to Joe Root at gully for a routine catch , before Murali Vijay ( 0 ) nicked Anderson to Cook at first slip .

Dhoni reached the interval unbeaten on 25 , with Ravindra Jadeja on 0 . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
