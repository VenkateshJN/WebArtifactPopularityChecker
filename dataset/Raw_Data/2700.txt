BCCI should ensure quality umpires , says Amre The author has posted comments on this article TNN | Mar 2 , 2015 , 10.50AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 BENGALURU : The defeat notwithstanding , Mumbai coach Praveen Amre was a proud man on Saturday. After being shot out for just 44 in their first innings , the 40-time champions fought the losing battle with the typical Mumbai never-say-die attitude . While Amre took pride in the performance of his young side , he was critical of the umpiring and urged BCCI to improve the quality of officiating during such important matches . " As a coach , I do n't want to give it as an excuse , but everybody has got evidence. I think BCCI should ensure quality umpires in big games , " the former India batsman said . Amre felt two crucial decisions went against his team on the opening day. While it appeared Aditya Tare had not edged a Vinay Kumar delivery , umpire Vineet Kulkarni thought otherwise. Likewise , Robin Uthappa was plumb in front , was the general consensus but the same umpire ruled him not out . " The match referees can watch the video , there is evidence. Robin 's decision at 303 ( was given not out ) , the match would have been different. Same thing with Tare 's decision which came at a vital time and I think those were the turning points , " a disappointed Amre said . After the opening day 's proceedings , Mumbai skipper Tare had expressed his displeasure and said , " Mumbai has been suffering from bad decisions for the last two-three years. But it 's a part of the game , we have to accept it. " The comment had attracted the BCCI 's attention and a reprimand followed .
