( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 WELLINGTON : Sri Lankan batsman Kumar Sangakkara joined an elite group of cricketers on Saturday when he became only the fifth to make 12,000 runs in his Test career . The prolific 37-year-old left-hander reached the milestone when he knocked Trent Boult square for two in Sri Lanka 's first innings of the second Test against New Zealand in Wellington . Sangakkara started the two-Test New Zealand series on 11,988 runs and after scoring six and one in the first Test in Christchurch , he was determined to get the final five in Wellington . " When he fails , it 's a coach 's nightmare. You have to throw ( balls to Sangakkara ) for hours and hours , " captain Angelo Mathews said ahead of the Test . " He 's been working really hard in the nets and he 's desperate to go out there and get some runs. " Since launching his Test career in 2000 , Sangakkara has made an impressive average of over 58.00 , including 37 centuries in 130 Tests. His highest score was 319 against Bangladesh . He is now number four on the all-time scoring list , although his average is higher even than Indian great Sachin Tendulkar , who tops the ranking with 15,921 runs in 200 Tests at 53.78 . Australian Ricky Ponting ( 13,378 at 51.85 ) , Jacques Kallis from South Africa ( 13,289 at 55.37 ) and India 's Rahul Dravid ( 13,288 at 52.31 ) round out the top five . Last month , Sangakkara became only the fourth batsman to surpass the 13,000-run mark in one-day internationals , achieving the feat in his 386th match . The ODI list is also headed by Tendulkar , who made 18,426 runs in 463 matches , ahead of Ponting with 13,704 runs from 375 ODIs and Sanath Jayasuriya of Sri Lanka , who has 13,430 runs in 445 games .
