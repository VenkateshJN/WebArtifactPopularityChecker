Kohli , Rayudu and Sharma star in 95-run win over Middlesex The author has posted comments on this article TNN | Aug 23 , 2014 , 11.02AM IST Ambati Rayudu chose to retire after scoring 72 off 82 balls ( 8x4 ) . ( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 LONDON : Virat Kohli has spent close to 75 days in England and was expected to lead the run-scoring charts in the five-match Test series . That though did n't happen as Kohli was terrorized by the seam and swing of James Anderson and could score just 134 runs in 10 innings. The talented batsman however found some form in the lone warm-up game against Middlesex at Lord 's on Friday as the visitors thumped the hosts by 95 runs . Stand-in skipper Kohli scored 71 off 75 balls ( 8x4 , 1x6 ) and added 104 runs for the fourth wicket with middle-order batsman Ambati Rayudu , who chose to retire after scoring 72 off 82 balls ( 8x4 ) . Barring their knocks , the Indian batting effort was nothing to write home about . Indian skipper MS Dhoni did n't play the game , but came out to field as substitute when the Indians were bowling. Perhaps , it was an indication of things to come in the ODIs where Sanju Samson could be asked to play the role of keeper-batsman . Dhoni 's presence on the field though did seem to inspire the bowlers as they defended 231 with gutso with young leggie Karn Sharma picking up 3-14 to bowl out Middlesex , who had England internationals Eoin Morgan and Steve Finn , for 135 . Bhuvneshwar Kumar ( 1-7 ) and Mohammad Shami ( 1-13 ) struck early blows to reduce the hosts to 112 in the fourth over. They never really recovered and wickets fell at regular intervals to hand India victory in under 40 overs . Mohit Sharma ( 1-20 ) , Umesh Yadav ( 1-32 ) and Dhawal Kulkarni ( 1-13 ) , who have been drafted in the ODI team , had a good work-out . Scores : India 230 ( Rayudu 72 , Kohli 71 ; Rayner 4-32 ) beat Middlesex 135 ( Karn 3-14 ) by 95 runs .
