Pakistan news February 18 , 2015 Luden stays as Pakistan fielding coach 38 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Comment shares 38 Grant Luden , Pakistan fielding coach , will remain in his role despite reports of his resignation , the Pakistan Cricket Board has said. Reports suggested Luden was contemplating quitting his job after a dispute with the players but the PCB denied that and confirmed that Luden will continue until his contract ends in May 2016 . ESPNcricinfo understands Luden was unhappy with the attitude of some players during drills. The players had also appeared upset and were seen exchanging harsh words with the coach , apparently questioning his lack of a high-profile record as a player. Luden has not played first-class cricket , but worked with the Bangladesh team as a coach from June 2008 before joining Pakistan in May last year . After the argument , Luden had wanted to resign but PCB director of operations Zakir Khan intervened , resolved his concerns and requested him to stay on . " The Pakistan Cricket Board and the team management as well as the boys hold the job he is doing in high esteem , and are keen that he continues to serve in his present role , " said a PCB spokesperson , " The entire team trained together Tuesday afternoon , in a spirit of camaraderie , under the supervision of head coach Waqar Younis with each of the other coaches and assistant manager Shahid Aslam actively involved throughout the extended four-hour session. Ditto for Wednesday , where some players were put through their paces by all coaches , with Mr Luden putting in an extra hour on both days with a select group of players " Luden had previously spoken with the PCB about parting ways after the World Cup due to personal reasons , but subsequently reversed his decision after further discussions .
