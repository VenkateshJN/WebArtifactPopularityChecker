Text Size Bravo bagged 86 wickets at an average of nearly 40. © Getty West Indies allrounder Dwayne Bravo has called time on his Test career. Bravo , whose last Test match was against Sri Lanka in December 2010 , made the announcement through a statement early on Saturday and said he had already informed the West Indies team about his decision , reports CMC . " Over the years , with the greatest enthusiasm , I have done my best with the deep awareness that I am ultimately representing the people of the game , " Bravo said in the statement. " I recognise that this is a difficult time for all of us. Our people of the region have seen and enjoyed great cricketing days but we will not return to glory until we agree to go forward with our love for the game and the respect of the administrators , players and the public. " Bravo 's announcement comes weeks after he was dropped from West Indies ' World Cup squad. Besides , his last ODI assignment as captain ended in controversy following West Indies ' abrupt pull-out from the India tour , after which he was dropped for the series against South Africa . The 31-year-old , who has had a decent Test career with 2200 runs and 86 wickets in 40 Tests , said he had tasted both success and devastating defeats during his career but had also accumulated joyous moments. " I have experienced the exhilarating joy of victory and the devastating pain of defeat. The joyous memories will remind me of what we are capable of achieving. I want to be part of that mission , " Bravo said . Bravo , however , will continue to play ODIs and T20s. Regarded by many as one of the leading ODI allrounders in world cricket , Bravo could n't quite create the same impact in the longer format. " I thank the cricketing fraternity for their support and look forward to serving you with determination and the pride of being a West Indian " , Bravo said . © Cricbuzz ( with inputs from agencies )
