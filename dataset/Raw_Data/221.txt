Posted by at February 14 , 2015 The skippers poor run of scores indicates that only a special player can juggle skippership with whichever discipline gets them in the side. I am sure Cook is not gleeful over his replacements failure but he must feel vindicated . Posted by mzm149 at February 13 , 2015 @ JG2704 : Broad is not in good touch off late. But he has been much better than Jordan , Woakes or Dernbach in general. Who would you count as your second strike bowler after Anderson ?
