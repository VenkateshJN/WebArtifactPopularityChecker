Sanath Jayasuriya and Muttiah Muralitharan played 408 international games together but never got to bat together © AFP Enlarge This is a continuation of the " fun article " theme. A completely irreverent look at cricket numbers. I had earlier come out with my own list of numbers and asked the readers to submit their numbers. They responded magnificently and , barring a few , one being the heart-felt tribute to Phillip Hughes , this is their list . So now it is time to have a chuckle , laugh , guffaw , and introspect for a moment when you come to 63 . There are well over 100 numbers in this follow-up list. To the extent possible I have done some verification. But there is no guarantee that this article is 100 % correct. My apologies for any errors that might have crept in . 0 : Number of times that Don Bradman was dismissed in the nineties throughout his Test career . 0 : Number of times that Kapil Dev has been run out in his long Test career . 0 : Number of runs scored by Garry Sobers in ODIs . 0 : Number of times Saeed Ajmal has bowled zero no-balls in an international innings . 0 : Number of wickets taken by Pramodya Wickramasinghe in the 1996 World Cup , although he got a winners medal and played as a specialist bowler in the quarter-final , semi-final and the final . 0.5 : Number of squash balls Adam Gilchrist placed inside his batting glove in the 2007 World Cup final . 1 : Number of bowlers to take three successive five-wicket hauls in ODIs ; Waqar Younis is the only one . 1 : Number of Test series where Kapil Dev went wicketless . 1 : Number of times Nos. 10 and 11 batsmen have hit centuries in the same first-class innings.

Both played one Test each . 2 : Number of tied Tests ; between India and Australia in 1986 and between West Indies and Australia in 1960 . 2 : Number of Test matches , though not tied , but where the scores were level at the end of the match ( the Test between India and West Indies in Mumbai in 2011 saw scores level with nine last-innings wicket falling.
