Bailey salutes match-winners Finch and Marsh The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Feb 14 , 2015 , 05.25PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 MELBOURNE : Australia skipper George Bailey praised match-winning centurion Aaron Finch and five-wicket star Mitchell Marsh after the World Cup co-hosts crushed England by 111 runs in their opening game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday . Finch , playing in front of his home crowd which swelled to almost 85,000 people , smashed 135 after being dropped on nought as Australia piled up 342-9 in their 50 overs . Marsh then claimed five for 33 as England slumped to a dispiriting loss despite James Taylor hitting an impressive 98 not out . " We were very happy to bat first. There was a lot of anticipation , a big build-up , but we felt like we have a strong batting line-up and it was nice to get out there and use that track first , " said Bailey . " Aaron Finch rose to the occasion. That 's what we 're after from our top order. We want great innings and to turn them into match-winning knocks and that 's definitely what we got today . " Mitchell Marsh was outstanding , he broke the game open for us. " England skipper Eoin Morgan flopped again with the bat as he was out for his fourth duck in five innings . He admitted that , with the exception of Taylor , England 's batting had let them down as they chased a 343-run target . " I think the score was probably above par even though the wicket was very good , " said Morgan . " Probably 310 was par , but we needed all three guns firing and the top order to come off for us to chase that . " Our fielding was poor and our death bowling not on target at times. James was unlucky at the end not to get a hundred and he struck the ball cleanly. " Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
