Â© Reuters Melbourne : When Mahendra Singh Dhoni was surprisingly named India 's captain in 2007 as senior players backed out of the inaugural World Twenty20 , he responded by leading his team to the title. ( Australian Media Criticises India ) Two years later , Dhoni was at the helm when India topped the Test rankings and , another two years later , he captained the nation to their second World Cup triumph in front of adoring home crowds in Mumbai . But the Dhoni magic was too good to last. He may still be regarded as India 's best limited-overs player but his uncanny ability to conjure wins in major tournaments seems to have deserted him . India were beaten by Sri Lanka in the final of the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh last year despite enjoying an unbeaten run in the tournament till then. ( India Outplayed by Better Team : Ganguly ) On Thursday , India succumbed to a 95-run World Cup semi-final loss to Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground after six straight wins in the league and one more against Bangladesh in the quarter-final . But it was once again Australia , the top-ranked one-day team , who got in the way as the tournament co-hosts built on their success over Dhoni 's men in the Tests and one-day tri-series which preceded the World Cup . As the Indians trudged off from the SCG after the match , the question asked was whether Dhoni will give up the captaincy -- or quit playing one-day cricket altogether. ( India 's Reign as World Champions Ends ) In late December , Dhoni made a shock retirement from Test cricket after the third Test of the four-match series against Australia , with the decision being announced by the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) through a media release .

Former batting great Sunil Gavaskar attributed the defeat to the pressure of chasing down a 300-plus target , but conceded Australia outplayed India with both bat and ball . " India succumbed under the pressure of big finals , " said Gavaskar. " The batsmen played irresponsibly and got out to some sloppy shots. " India won in 2011 with an established line-up that included batting record-holder Sachin Tendulkar and other seasoned players like Virender Sehwag , Gautam Gambhir , Yuvraj Singh , Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh . In this edition , Dhoni was the elder statesman of a relatively young team that will form the nucleus of the side till the next World Cup in England in four years ' time .
