Â© Getty Images Wellington : Martin Guptill 's record-shattering double century and Trent Boult 's four-wicket haul sent New Zealand sailing into the World Cup semi-finals as they trounced the West Indies by 143 runs on Saturday. ( Scorecard | Highlights ) Guptill , dropped on four by Marlon Samuels , finished on 237 not out , the highest individual score in World Cup history and the second largest one-day international innings of all time , as he led New Zealand to 393 for six in their 50 overs at Wellington Stadium . Boult backed up the opening batsman 's feat by taking four for 44 to move to the top of the tournament wicket-takers list with 19 as the West Indies folded for 250 in the 31st over . The kept up with the required run rate , reaching 200 in the 25th over , but by then they were already seven wickets down . Chris Gayle , shrugging off the effects of a long-standing back injury , cracked 61 off 33 balls , including eight of the 31 sixes in the match as batsmen on both sides plundered the short boundaries . New Zealand will now play South Africa in the first semi-final at Auckland 's Eden Park on Tuesday , with fellow co-hosts Australia facing defending champions India in Sydney two days later . - McCullum setback - New Zealand , favourites for Saturday 's match after emerging unbeaten from pool play , had a rocky start when regular batting hero , captain and opener Brendon McCullum , fell cheaply for 12 . But Guptill , coming into form late in the tournament , took up the challenge as he blasted his second successive century after scoring 105 against Bangladesh in New Zealand 's concluding pool match . He chewed up the West Indies attack , hitting 24 fours and 11 sixes from 163 deliveries faced as he overtook the previous best World Cup score of 215 set by Gayle earlier in this tournament against Zimbabwe . In all one-day internationals , Guptill 's unbeaten 237 is second only to Rohit Sharma 's 264 against Sri Lanka in Kolkata last year , and broke his own New Zealand record of 189 not out scored against England in 2013 . Following the fall of McCullum , Guptill featured in a 62-run partnership with Kane Williamson ( 33 ) and then added a significant 143 in 135 balls with Ross Taylor ( 42 ) for the third wicket . In the closing charge , Guptill and Grant Elliott ( 27 ) took 19 balls to add a further 55 , as New Zealand posted 153 runs in the final 10 overs to further deflate the West Indies after McCullum won the toss and opted to bat . Jerome Taylor , who had Guptill dropped in this first over , returned the best figures for the West Indies with three for 71 , while Andre Russell took two for 96 . Boult was on the money in his first over when he bowled Johnson Charles for three with his second delivery . He followed-up with the wickets of Lendl Simmons ( 12 ) , Samuels ( 27 ) and Denesh Ramdin ( nought ) to have four for 18 after five overs . Gayle was in a particularly ferocious mood , belting spinner Daniel Vettori out of the attack after one over which cost 21 runs . In one two-over spell by Tim Southee , Gayle and Samuels hit 33 runs , leaving New Zealand 's senior paceman to finish with the less-than-impressive figures of two for 82 . The 36-year-old Vettori broke the Gayle-Samuels partnership when he flung his 1.91 metre ( 6ft 3in ) frame into the air to save a six and pull off a remarkable one-handed catch on the boundary . Adam Milne , like Southee and Boult , was also expensive but had the satisfaction of bowling Gayle . Corey Anderson had Darren Sammy caught behind for 27 , leaving the West Indies 166 for six , before Vettori and Southee stepped in to work their way through the stubborn tail .
