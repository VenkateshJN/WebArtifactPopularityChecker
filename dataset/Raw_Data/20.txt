What is the UK 's favourite IPL team ? by Alan Gardner 4/7/2015 6 : 37 : 05 PM by Alan Gardner 4/7/2015 6 : 37 : 02 PM 3rd & 7 37yd close - Thanks for your votes , everyone. CSK are the Manchester United of the IPL , according to Rollski , and it seems they are just as popular. For the 77 % in favour , we 'll be bringing you coverage of the whole tournament ; those that are less keen , do n't worry , there will still be plenty on England in the Caribbean , as well as our usual county reporting. The first round of the Championship begins on Sunday and the live blog will be back to provide you with updates. Until then , cheerio . by Alan Gardner 4/7/2015 6 : 41 : 37 PM The mostly inane commentary , is stupidly frantic and very irritating , However , it is often the only cricket available if you do n't want to line Murdoch 's hateful pockets. The skills are nevertheless sublime. It has changed all aspects of the game , some for the good and some not necessarily so. This is down to a personal point of view. The recent world cup has clearly been affected. Captaincy has come to the fore and this must be a good thing. However , 20Twenty ( and 2 balls in ODIs ) has taken the game away from bowlers and this is a clear worry. No game remains the same ! ! ! Cricket is like a language - constantly evolving. If it remains static , it goes stagnant and eventually dies .....or becomes fossilized. No-one I hope wants to see this happen to cricket. People often harp on about the golden past..... but how many batsmen on their way to a triple century etc... would have been out LBW 500 times , or bowlers in their 7th 10wicket match , would have been no-balled more many of them ? ? Cricket has always been changing and long may it do so ! ! ! by Rugmeister 4/7/2015 6 : 16 : 21 PM Can not believe that Chennai have so many votes. I detest them. They 're like the Manchester United of the IPL . by Rollski 4/7/2015 5 : 06 : 25 PM IPL should be banned as it has ruined the real structure of cricket..so many matches r fixed...its all abt money...can someone tell me how its benefiting Associate members...every year we waste 2 months for this all-glamour-commercialised--fixed mayches tournament..trust me its an insult to tge cricket n its norms..even indian high court has mentioned how dhoni raina n others were involved in one of ipl 's addition..i would request ICC ...plzz ban this tournament ...for the sake n betterment of cricket..thanks by Aish 4/7/2015 4 : 15 : 50 PM Tbh it makes me cringe every time it 's on , ESP the commentry , that 's why no serious commentator will sign up. The reason for this is because it 's all staged , they are told what to say and when. It 's run by corrupt people through out and unfortunately our great game is being made to suffer. The ICC has given it credibility as india is now the financial powerhouse and can dictate as and when. india clearly have no interest in test cricket anymore and wishes to take everyone down this silly route with them . by Zain khan 4/7/2015 4 : 10 : 55 PM @ AlanGardner Yup , fair enough. That 's why I 've got no problem with the site 's IPL coverage on the UK page . Interesting to note , though , that as of typing , the " No " and " Indifferent " brackets would be the third and fifth most popular IPL teams ! : D ( After multiplying the other figures by 77 % . ) by Balladeer 4/7/2015 4 : 10 : 03 PM @ Balladeer - No problem , though it seems like you 're in the vocal minority . by Alan Gardner 4/7/2015 4 : 02 : 41 PM @ Rick Believe me , I come through the UK edition. There are still huge amounts of IPL coverage on the front page . Despite how I may sound , though , I 'm not that annoyed. My previous post was mostly a joke. If it 's popular among those in the UK , and the second poll suggests that it is , then fair enough - and it 's not like there 's much other cricket going on at the moment right now. I 'll just filter it out , like I did last year . But a poll asking for the impressions of Brits regarding the IPL is going to attract answers such as mine below ! And it ought to have a category for those who could n't care less , to get a representative cross-section of British views. In my opinion , natch . by Balladeer 4/7/2015 3 : 55 : 18 PM @ Balladeer Fair point , well taken ! I can see how the constant prominent coverage on cricinfo itself would irk some fans. There 's always the UK edition . by Rick 4/7/2015 3 : 45 : 56 PM @ Rick Only until it stops appearing on Cricinfo. ; ) by Balladeer 4/7/2015 3 : 41 : 01 PM How can you tell if a British cricket fan is n't interested in the IPL ? They 'll tell you ! by Rick 4/7/2015 3 : 39 : 32 PM @ AlanGardner Many thanks . by Balladeer 4/7/2015 3 : 02 : 56 PM I find myself only watching the IPL because it was the only free-to-air cricket available in the UK while studying in the afternoons. Usually tuned in with the sound muted because the commentators are n't to my tastes , and the crowds love cheering for every individual run , which gets a tad frustrating after a time.. . by Pete Naylor 4/7/2015 3 : 01 : 21 PM Thanks for feedback , folks , as ever. Secondary poll created for the refuseniks.. . by Alan Gardner 4/7/2015 2 : 56 : 46 PM I dont see a box which says neither , i dont really watch it as i hate IpL as it is nothing more than a circus , none of these teams i can relate to by Ian Gatward 4/7/2015 2 : 55 : 45 PM What is this IPL you speak of ? I am not familiar by Gaffer 4/7/2015 2 : 44 : 07 PM Ca n't stand the commercial nature of the IPL. It 's a six , not a " DLF Maximum " for God 's sake ! It 's targeted at Indian fans , and understandably so , so please stop forcing it upon us here in the UK. It also goes on for too long . by BritCricFan 4/7/2015 2 : 41 : 14 PM I 'm with Balladeer in the fact that I do n't care much for the IPL and would n't mind a button on the poll to reflect that . by Garry Pursell 4/7/2015 2 : 41 : 01 PM Err... Where 's the option for " none of them , and I hate how the IPL has shifted the balance of cricket , financially and as she is played " ? No offence to IPL fans , none at all - enjoy what you want ! I just despise it personally . by Balladeer 4/7/2015 2 : 35 : 01 PM Ricky Ponting , Rohit Sharma and Sachin Tendulkar discuss who are favourites for the County Championship by Alan Gardner 4/7/2015 2 : 19 : 03 PM The eighth edition of the IPL begins on Wednesday. Here in the UK , we will be keeping half an eye on all things Super Kings and Sunrisers-shaped in between covering England in the West Indies and the start of the Championship. Does your finger twitch on the remote when the IPL comes around ( even if it is now on Sky rather than ITV4 ) ? If so , why not tell us your views and take part in our poll : which is your favourite IPL team ? by Alan Gardner 4/7/2015 2 : 13 : 08 PM
