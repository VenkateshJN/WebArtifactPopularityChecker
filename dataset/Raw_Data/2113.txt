( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 NEW DELHI : The Supreme Court on Friday said it will hear on April 16 BCCI 's plea seeking transcripts of audio tapes containing statements of board president N Srinivasan and Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni , recorded by the Justice Mukul Mudgal Committee which probed allegations of IPL betting and spot-fixing . However , BCCI 's plea was opposed by Bihar Cricket Association ( BCA ) which questioned the locus standi of the board in seeking the transcripts of statements of Srinivasan , who has been kept out of the affairs of the cricket , and Dhoni . Senior advocate Ajeet Sinha , appearing for BCA , submitted that BCCI can not seek copies of the transcripts on behalf of Srinivasan and Dhoni . He submitted that if the transcripts are supplied to BCCI then those should also be given to BCA . BCCI counsel CA Sundaram said without the transcripts of the audio tapes it would be very difficult for him to respond in the matter . A bench comprising A K Patnaik and J S Khehar posted the matter for April 16 , saying that it will see everything on the next date of hearing . In its application filed earlier , BCCI had also sought the transcripts of statements by Sundar Raman , the Chief Operating Officer of IPL . Earlier , the apex court had proposed the name of veteran cricketer and commentator Sunil Gavaskar to head the board for IPL 7 during pendency of the case in the apex court .
