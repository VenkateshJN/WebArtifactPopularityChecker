( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 AHMEDABAD : Holders Karnataka retained the Vijay Hazare Trophy after defeating Punjab convincingly by a whopping 156 runs in the final. Set to score 360 for a win , Punjab were skittled out for 203 in 38.2 overs in the daynight encounter at the Motera on Tuesday . Perhaps it was a bad decision by Punjab skipper Harbhajan Singh to put Karnataka in after winning the toss. But it was compounded by their spearhead Sandeep Sharma 's lack of form as he was a pale shadow of what he was during the group stage and early knock-out games. The team management 's decision to rest the fast bowler for the semifinal backfired as he could n't find his rhythm and bled like anything till he bowled the last over when he picked up two wickets off successive deliveries. He had figures of 3 for 68 from nine overs . Sharma 's new ball partner Siddharth Kaul bowled a few good deliveries in between but overall he too had a forgettable game , going wicketless for 72 runs from eight overs. The track was an ideal one for batting , and though Baltej Singh , Amitoze Singh , Harbhajan and Yuvraj Singh all tried their best to stop the run flow , the Karnataka juggernaut rolled on with ease. Punjab saved a few runs with their fielding but their bowling just gave it all away. Baltej was the pick of the Punjab bowlers with three for 59 from nine overs . Mayank Agarwal 's third List A hundred and his record 162-run firstwicket partnership with Robin Uthappa in 24.2 overs helped defending champions Karnataka post a massive 359 for the loss of seven wickets. This also happens to be the highest total in this tournament beating the previous best of 3494 by Gujarat against Saurashtra . Brief scoores : Karnataka 359 for 7 ( M Agarwal 125 , R Uthappa 87 , K Nair 86 ; Baltej 3-59 ) beat Punjab 203 ( Mandeep 76 ; Mithun 3-37 ) by 156 runs Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
