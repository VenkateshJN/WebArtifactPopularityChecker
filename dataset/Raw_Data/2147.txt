The MCA is miffed with the CCI for Brabourne staging the IPL Eliminator without their 'permission. ' ( TOI Photo ) RELATED MUMBAI : Big-time cricket will return to its original home in India on Wednesday night . The historic Brabourne Stadium will stage its first IPL game in four years when the Mumbai Indians , with roughly 25,000 enthusiastic fans cheering their heart out for them , take on the Chennai Super Kings in the Eliminator . " We are thrilled and excited that cricket is back at the iconic Brabourne. Legendary Indian cricketers like CK Nayudu , Vijay Merchant and Tiger Pataudi have played at this venue. We are looking forward to the game , " Cricket Club of India ( CCI ) president Sevanti Parekh told TOI on Tuesday . CCI went on to host 17 Tests till a dispute with the Mumbai Cricket Association ( MCA ) over allocation of tickets saw national cricket in Mumbai move to Wankhede Stadium , situated just half a mile away , in 1975 . Incidentally , almost 40 years later , the MCA is again miffed with the CCI for Brabourne staging the IPL Eliminator without their 'permission.' Parekh , though , is willing to bury the hatchet , and has invited top MCA officials for the match. " We enjoy a very good relationship with them. We 'll be happy if they come for the tie and grace the occasion , " said Parekh . CCI has a series of firsts to its credit. The venue hosted the first T20 international on Indian soil on October 20 , 2007 when newly crowned World T20 champs India beat Australia by six wickets . The ground also witnessed history being made when it hosted a Test match after 36 years in December 2009 when India beat Sri Lanka by an innings to be crowned World No. 1 . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Mumbai Indians,Mumbai Cricket Association,IPL,Chennai Super Kings,CCI Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
