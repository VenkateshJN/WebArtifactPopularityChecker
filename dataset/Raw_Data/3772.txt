India 's performance in Australia could have been better The author has posted comments on this article Gaurav Gupta , TNN | Jan 12 , 2015 , 09.07AM IST Kohli and Vijay came out with flying colours during the Test series against Australia. ( Reuters Photo ) Page 1 of 4 While the likes of Kohli , Vijay and Rahane came out with flying colours during the Test series against Australia , a few other batsmen , and almost all the bowlers , were found wanting . TOI rates the performance of India 's Test team : Virat Kohli : Has any international batsman , for that matter , played Mitchell Johnson more comfortably , and that too after challenging the deadly fast bowler for a duel ? Kohli , without a doubt , was the man of the tour , inspiring the entire team. Kohli showed the courage to look the Aussies in the eye , and then backed up his cockiness with an exemplary performance with the bat. Kohli made a couple of mistakes in his first Test as captain , leaving out R Ashwin and going for the chase despite the option of a draw. But as Sydney showed , he is learning fast . Matches : 4 , Runs : 692 , HS : 169 , Avg : 86.50 , 100 : 4 , 50 : 1 MARKS : 9/10 MS Dhoni : Missed the first Test , played in the next two , and then left everyone stunned with his sudden decision to retire from Test cricket. Calling it a day in the middle of a tough series was clearly not expected from a player of his stature . Matches : 2 , Runs : 68 , HS : 33 , Avg : 22.66 , 100 : 0 , 50 : 0 MARKS : 3/10 Ajinkya Rahane : Continued to grow in stature as the India 's most reliable batsman overseas. Matched Kohli stroke-for-stroke during his memorable 262-run partnership for the fourth wicket with the latter at the MCG. His 147-run knock during that innings , which came off merely 171 balls and contained 21 glorious fours , left the spectators mesmerized and the Aussie bowlers clueless. Showed how he can alter his game according to the situation when he saved the Sydney Test for India with a doughty , unbeaten 38 . Matches : 4 , Runs : 399 , HS : 147 , Avg : 57.00 , 100 : 1 , 50 : 2 MARKS : 8/10 Murali Vijay : Along with Kohli and Rahane , Vijay was the shining light of the tour for India. Even as his partner Shikhar Dhawan floundered , Vijay provided the perfect example of how a solid opener can help the team launch into a big score. His dismissal for 99 in the first Test triggered a collapse that saw India lose the Adelaide Test. Displaying the patience of a monk , Vijay showed impeccable judgement outside off stump. His cover drives were pleasing , and so was the way he used his feet to kill Nathan Lyon 's spin . Matches : 4 , Runs : 482 , HS : 144 , Avg : 60.25 , 100 : 1 , 50 : 4 MARKS : 8/10 Rohit Sharma : Arrived on this tour with his reputation enhanced thanks to his record score of 264 in an ODI against Sri Lanka at Kolkata. However , the first two Tests provided a cruel reality check. Batting at the crucial No. 6 position , Rohit got out at critical times , a factor which hurt India massively. His attempt to sledge Johnson backfired badly , with the wound-up pacer bouncing India out at Brisbane. Dropped from the MCG Test , this 'gifted ' batsman did much better at No 3 in Sydney but fell to a poor shot in both the innings . Matches : 3 , Runs : 173 , HS : 53 , Avg : 28.83 , 100 : 0 , 50 : 1 MARKS : 3/10 Shikhar Dhawan : This series may have just finished the selectors ' patience with Dhawan. The left-hander kept getting starts , but failed to convert them into big scores. His weaknesses outside off-stump continued to tail him on this tour as well. His refusal to bat after suffering an injury at Brisbane , even as India fought to save the Test , completely overshadowed the lone half-century he scored in the series. Eventually , he lost his place to Rahul in the final Test . Matches : 3 , Runs : 167 , HS : 81 , Avg : 27.83 , 100 : 0 , 50 : 1 MARKS : 3/10 KL Rahul : Getting out to rash strokes in both innings of his debut Test , the Karnataka youngster endured a nightmarish debut. It seemed to be getting worse when he dropped a sitter in his next game , but KL Rahul showed nerves of steel to bounce back from it all by cracking a superb hundred at the SCG. Has India found the perfect all to Vijay at the top ? Matches : 2 , Runs : 130 , HS : 110 , Avg : 32.50 , 100 : 1 , 50 : 0 MARKS : 5/10 Cheteshwar Pujara : Pujara would have expected better results than England in this series , but that was n't to be. The Saurashtra batsman , who was expected to fill in the big shoes of Rahul Dravid at one point , looked more vulnerable with every innings , and eventually lost his berth in the XI. While the Aussie seamers kept exploiting his weaknesses outside the off stump , Pujara looked ill at ease against Lyon 's spin too. Except for the first innings at Adelaide , the No. 3 bat found runs hard to come . Matches : 3 , Runs : 201 , HS : 73 , Avg : 33.50 , 100 : 0 , 50 : 1 MARKS : 3/10 Ishant Sharma : He bowled well in patches , but for someone who has played 61 Tests , Ishant still did n't look like the leader of the attack. Worryingly , he is going down on pace too. In the three Tests that he played in , the Delhi pacer managed all of four wickets in the first innings , which meant that when it was the time to strike the key blows , he was missing . Matches : 3 , Wickets : 9 , Best Bowling : 3-38 , Avg : 48.22 . MARKS : 3/10 Mohammad Shami : Was the highest-wicket taker for India , but that is nothing more than a footnote of the story ! Bowling short repeatedly , Shami ended up being cannon fodder for batsmen who thrive on cutting and pulling the ball . Matches : 3 , Wickets : 15 , Best Bowling : 5-112 , Avg : 35.80 MARKS : 4/10 Umesh Yadav : Making a comeback into the Test team , one of the quickest bowlers on show in the series , had a golden chance to seal his spot in the Indian team. Instead , with his erratic and directionless bowling , Yadav has now put a serious question mark over his Test career . Matches : 3 , Wickets : 11 , Best Bowling : 3-101 , Avg : 49.81 MARKS : 2.5/10 R Ashwin : Bowled well most of the times , which was crucial since the seamers were all over the place , but was easily outshone by rival offie Nathan Lyon. The problem was that unlike Llyon , Ashwin chose to bowl a far more defensive line , which most of the times started on the middle stump . Matches : 3 , Wickets : 12 , Best Bowling : 4-105 , Avg : 48.66 MARKS : 4/10 Karn Sharma : It would be unfair to judge him after just one game , and it 's never easy for a spinner to begin his career in Australia . MARKS : 3/10 Bhuvneshwar Kumar : This was a forgettable series for this talented swing bowler. Nursing an ankle injury , Bhuvneshwar looked out of sorts in the only Test he played . MARKS : 2/10 Varun Aaron : For the first time in his career , Aaron seemed injury free and ready to fire all cylinders. But he turned out to be wayward and expensive . MARKS : 2/10 Suresh Raina : It was never going to be easy for Raina to make a successful comeback straightaway after playing his last Test in September 2012. He will be haunted by the pair he got . MARKS : 0/10 Wriddhiman Saha : Had the opportunity to grab Dhoni 's spot for good , but did n't exactly do justice to it . MARKS : 3/10 .
