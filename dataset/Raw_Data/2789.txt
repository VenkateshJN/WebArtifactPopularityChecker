He was New Zealand 's bowling coach from 2008 to 2010 and was also associated with the Bangladesh side as their coach till last year. Jurgensen , who has closely watched the emergence of cricketers such as Tim Southee during his time , feels New Zealand have a potent attack which can deliver in Sunday 's marquee clash against Australia . " The New Zealand bowling attack possesses variety and they complement each other so well. They have great skill and belief , " said Jurgensen , chatting with TOI on Saturday . Tim Southee had mentioned the most-notable quality Jurgensen had infused into the side. " The drive to go for wickets despite the batsmen going after you was the biggest lesson he taught us , " Southee had said . The seeds of an attacking mindset were sowed during Jurgensen 's time , a trait that stayed with the team till date. The 38-year-old Fiji coach is pleased with the way New Zealand have played their game . " They have an attacking mindset now more than ever with their captain Brendon McCullum , coach and bowling coach being on the same page , " noted Jurgensen . Grant Elliott may be a household name in NZ now but he 's an extremely grounded man , recalls Jurgensen. " About five years ago , I urged Elliott to make an appearance at the Brisbane Warehouse competition and he immediately agreed. " The Queenslander feels it Aussies will be a tough side to tame. " OZ were going to be hard to beat because of the match-winners they possess. " Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
