India rour of Australia , 2014-15 Mitchell Johnson praises Virat Kohli for his aggressive approach Melbourne , 2015/Jan/02 02 : 47 : 00 Text Size Johnson and Kohli have been involved in a few verbal duels. © Getty Mitchell Johnson , Australia 's spearhead , has praised Virat Kohli for his aggressive approach towards playing cricket. Despite losing the first Test in Adelaide , the Indian team put up a fight and gave Australia a run for their money under Kohli 's captaincy. Kohli also led the team from the front by notching up twin hundreds in that game. With MS Dhoni announcing his retirement from Test cricket , Kohli has now been appointed as the full-time captain of the Indian unit . " It could be quite interesting because they are not known for that aggressive type of play. However , ever since I have seen him [ Kohli ] play cricket , I have always seen him being pretty fiery. So , he will definitely be an aggressive type of captain I think in the way he sets fields , and I think you 'll see a lot different to what Dhoni did. He is a fierce competitor and he really does like to get involved in it all , " Johnson was quoted as saying by The Hindu . There have been a few verbal duels between Johnson and Kohli during the series. In particular , during the third Test , Kohli played a delivery back to Johnson , who then threw it back at the stumps , taking down the batsman inadvertently. The incident was followed by the two players getting into a duel. Johnson , on his part , said that aggression is a key part of Kohli 's game . " It does n't matter who he plays against , he plays in your face and that is how he likes to play the game. Kohli has just been telling us how many runs he has scored and we have just been saying were two-nil up in the series , so that is pretty much it. It has always been part of the game and always will be , " Johnson concluded . © Cricbuzz ( with inputs from agencies )
