Mumbai Indians v Kings XI Punjab , IPL 2015 , Mumbai April 11 , 2015 Batting fixes in order at Wankhede Start time 2000 local ( 1430 GMT ) Play 02 : 18 Agarkar : Match-winners aplenty on both sides Big picture After losses in their respective first games , Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab have a few issues to fix when they face each other. Mumbai Indians ' innings stuttered at the start in Kolkata against the pace of Morne Morkel and Umesh Yadav , and Kings XI did not fare any better in Pune against James Faulkner and Tim Southee. Wankhede Stadium could provide respite from those lively pitches and allow the strokemakers to flourish . But it 's the bowling that could prove to be the difference between the teams. While Kings XI looked well-rounded with pace , swing , and spin , Mumbai Indians hardly made an impression against Knight Riders. Lasith Malinga 's bulging waistline maybe hampering his bowling , or maybe the batsmen are used to him , but he did not look menacing at all. Pragyan Ojha , with his remodelled action , appeared to have lost his bite and Harbhajan Singh has long been on the wane. That Josh Hazlewood decided to opt out is going to put more pressure on the current lot . Kings XI would be satisfied with the way they bowled and are not likely to change a thing at Wankhede , except , perhaps the batting order , with promotions for David Miller and George Bailey. It is likely to be a run-fest. Mumbai Indians score their runs at comfortably more than eight an over on this ground , but Kings XI , in their seven matches here , score at a rate even faster than the home side . Watch out for … Kieron Pollard is one of the icon players for Mumbai Indians but was almost invisible in the first game in Kolkata. He did not bowl , he did not get a chance to bat and when he took a catch , it was one of the easiest chances , not a madcap one-handed leap. In Mumbai , while in the outfield , he usually gets the crowd going. That was not going to happen in Kolkata. Now back in Mumbai , expect Pollard to be more vocal , more present . Playing his first IPL match in six years , Anureet Singh impressed not only with his movement - his known strength - but also his pace. One of his deliveries on Friday was clocked at 148 kph. He was as incisive from over the stumps as around , which added another dimension to his bowling. Kings XI let go an experienced bowler in L Balaji , but if Anureet keeps bowling like he did against Rajasthan Royals , Kings XI will continue posing problems for top-order batsmen . Stats and trivia Kings XI boast of the highest score by any team at Wankhede in the IPL - 226 v Chennai Super Kings , in 2014 Mumbai Indians broke their five-match losing streak last season with a win against Kings XI at Wankhede. They chased down the 169-run target in the 20th over Sixteen , the number of maiden overs bowled at Wankhede , which is the joint-second along with Eden Gardens for most maidens at a ground. Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur is at the top of the list with 19 maidens Devashish Fuloria is a sub-editor at ESPNcricinfo © ESPN Sports Media Ltd .

Bumrah and Akshay are selected as MI do n't have any good Indian bowlers in their squad. Ojha and Malinga went past their prime.

MumbaiIndiansOfficialOffice on April 11 , 2015 , 23 : 20 GMT Dear Viewers, The only change from the last playing XI is that Shreyas Gopal is picked ahead of Pragyan Ohja , as he is a Leg-Spinner , which Maxwell had struggled against last season and also that Shreyas Gopal can also bat . Regards Mumbai Indians Headquaters . JRP100 on April 11 , 2015 , 22 : 05 GMT Do n't think axar should bat up the order , but I 'd like to see him putting in some better performances in the lower order. it would be a big help as he is young and jadeja appears to be on the decline. .

D.S.A on April 11 , 2015 , 19 : 15 GMT Anureet 's end-of-innings bowling was superb and was doing so in the Champions League too. The Kings XI should be going in with the eleven that more closely resembles their Champions League eleven i.e. no Johnson and Perera instead , but also with a greater reliance on their Indian bowlers which they have quite a few , along with Perera 's and Maxwell 's bowling , and Vohra as an opener , probably for Sehwag . 1. M.Vohra , 2. M.Vijay , 3. G.Maxwell , 4. W.Saha , 5. D.Miller , 6. G.Bailey , 7. T.Perera , 8. A.Patel , 9. A.Singh , 10. K.Singh , 11. S.Sharma . They should look to select Gurkeerat , somehow or another , perhaps occasionally replacing Saha. He is a brilliant batsman . If the Kings XI are reserving a spot for an international fast bowler , they should have more than Johnson and Hendricks in their squad , and that applies to last season too. McClenaghan ? He was available last season , at his base price too. An impactful T20 bowler , unlike Johnson . FiGhtCluB_99 on April 11 , 2015 , 18 : 40 GMT Anureet was impressive indeed , but I wo n't get excited about the speed ( 148kmph ) . I remember Vinay Kumar clocking 145 a couple of years ago in the IPL which makes us think about the accuracy of the IPL speed guns . No featured comments at the moment .
