1 ( 1nb , 1w ) 14.3 to Rahane , 132.8 kph , he has thrown it away ! Poor shot from Rahane. Fifth time Rahane dismissed by Finn. He comes down the pitch and looks to whack the back of length delivery over midwicket but the extra bounce means it hits the splice of the bot and balloons towards mid-on where the fielder backpedals and takes an easy catch 57/2 16.4 to Kohli , 134.5 kph , he is gone ! The extra bounce has done him here. He looks to dab the back of length delivery towards third man but this rises up and catches the shoulder of the bat... It flies high and Buttler takes a good catch behind the stumps. That is an action replay of Kohli 's dismissal in the first innings of the Brisbane Test 64/3 18.6 to Rayudu , 131.1 kph , Numero tres for Finn ! ! This is not too different from how Kohli got out.. back of length , rising outside off , Rayudu looks to guide it to third man but gets a thick edge to the keeper. It 's that extra bounce again. Indian batsmen being swallowed at the Gabbatoir 67/5 36.1 to Dhoni , 129.6 kph , gets his man ! Finn has four now. Dhoni could n't add on after that chance. It 's a slower bounce on the leg stump line , Dhoni goes for the hook but feathers it to the keeper 137/6 36.2 to Patel , 136.2 kph , he has got his five-for ! Excellent bowling from round the stump. This one is fuller and comes in a touch to beat the inside edge.. goes through the gap and hits the top of off. Happy birthday Axar. It 's his second golden duck in two games 137/7
