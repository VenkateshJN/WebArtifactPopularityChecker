" Shikhar 's dismissal was on the softer side because that was the time when we could have milked the Australian bowling. There was no need to play a big shot but there 's pressure chasing 320 and pressure makes you do things you do n't want to , " Dhoni said.The skipper felt it was a par score , which at one stage seemed would touch or go beyond the 350-mark. " They played very good cricket. Over 300 is always difficult to score , " said Dhoni . The Indian captain took the opportunity on Thursday to convey to the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) - on a personal note - that the new ODI rules certainly were n't helping the game.He talked about batsmen playing innovative sweeps and reverse sweeps for easy boundaries while the spinners - who do the bulk of the bowling for any team in the middle-overs of a One-day innings - were gradually losing relevance . " It 's a bit old school but I 'd like to see spinners bowling to the batsmen with that added flight , making for a good contest between bat and ball , " Dhoni said.The skipper said he 'd prefer not making the 50-over game like T20 because a lot of sixes and fours can make ODIs boring. " The essence of ODI cricket is how you bat in the middle overs , " he added . © TNN
