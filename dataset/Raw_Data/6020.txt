Wilson 80 takes Ireland over the line Ireland vs United Arab Emirates , 16th Match , Pool B Wed , Feb 25 2015 by CB Staff Gary Wilson 's 80 helped Ireland cross the line in a tense finish against UAE . Ireland 's wicket-keeper batsman , Gary Wilson struck a fluent 69-ball 80 to pip UAE in a cliffhanger at the Gabba in Brisbane. Wilson walked in to bat in the 26th over after UAE captain Mohammad Tauqir 's double-strike had reduced Ireland to a precarious 97/4 . With Ireland chasing 279 against a resilient UAE side , Wilson , who was promoted above the big hitting Kevin O'Brien began his innings by nudging the UAE spinners and picking up quick singles. He scored his first forceful shot only off the 20th ball he faced - a sweep to a Tauqir delivery for four . Wilson , who attacked the medium pace of Krishnachandran Karate , dominated the 74-run fifth-wicket stand with Andrew Balbirnie ( 30 ) before the latter was dismissed by Mohammad Naveed. With the asking rate climbing above nine runs per over , Wilson and new man Kevin O'Brien utilized the batting powerplay to great effect. The Irish keeper quietly brought up his half-century off 48 deliveries even as O'Brien went on a leather hunt at the other end . The duo compiled a brisk 72-run stand before O'Brien was dismissed. Wilson then took the role of the aggressor , smashing four boundaries of Mohammad Naveed to bring the asking rate down to less than a run-a-ball. His innings came to an end in the 48th over of the chase with Ireland requiring only 12 runs for a win. An innings that alternated between patient accumulating and calculated assault pipped the valiant efforts of Shaiman Anwar ( who scored a century for UAE ) and helped Ireland complete a thrilling final-over win .
