January 11 down the years The Wall Rahul Dravid is born , and Hanif Mohammad falls one short of 500 shares 1973 When Sourav Ganguly made a hundred in his first Test innings , at Lord 's in 1996 , Rahul Dravid , who was born today , made 95 - nearly the first instance of two new caps scoring hundreds in the same innings. Both shared a record one-day stand of 318 against Sri Lanka at Taunton in the 1999 World Cup. In 2002 , Dravid made four consecutive Test hundreds , including a masterful 148 in dreadful conditions at Headingley to set India up for a rare overseas victory. That was followed by his awesome display on the tour to Australia in 2003-04 : in the second Test , he batted a phenomenal 835 minutes , scoring 233 and an unbeaten 72 , and steered India to a famous win. He went on to feature famously in overseas wins in Pakistan and the West Indies , and captained India to their first win in South Africa and first series win in England for 21 years. He resigned the captaincy soon after that last series , in 2007. A month later he was dropped from the one-day squad. His Test career trundled along with few bumps on the way , but in March 2008 he became the third Indian to get to 10,000 runs in Tests and by 2011 was the second highest run-maker after Sachin Tendulkar. That year was especially fruitful for Dravid. After a lean 2010 - by his standards - he ended 2011 as the top run-scorer , with five hundreds , including three on a tough tour of England , and four half-centuries , and retired after a poor series in Australia later that year. Dravid became the first player to take 200 catches in Tests - in a famous win for India in Durban - in 2010-11 . 1959 Mighty little Hanif Mohammad enjoyed occupying the crease , but this was ridiculous. Batting for Karachi against Bahawalpur in Karachi , he tried to steal a run to keep the strike. World record though it was at the time , there 's something excruciating about a scorecard entry that reads : run out for 499. Hanif 's partner that day , Abdul Aziz , was tragically young when he had another one later that season : absent dead. We kid you not . 1994 Another huge score on the subcontinent , this time by a team , or at least most of one. Hyderabad declared at 944 for 6 against Andhra Pradesh in Secunderabad. Maturi Sridhar made 366 , Vivek Jaisimha 211 and Noel David 207 - but Andhra held out for a draw with three wickets left and 502 runs to get . 1998 Muttiah Muralitharan did n't take ten wickets in any of his first 34 Tests , but after doing so for the first time on this day , against Zimbabwe in Kandy , he went on to do it more than 20 times in the rest of his career. Murali 's second-innings 7 for 94 won this match for Sri Lanka by eight wickets . 1973 Needing only 158 to win the Sydney Test , Pakistan reached 83 for 3 only to collapse to 106 all out and lose the three-match series 0-3. Max Walker , in his perennial role as faithful third change , emerged from the shadows to take 5 for 3 in his last 30 balls to finish with 6 for 15 from 16 overs . 1979 An Australian side deprived of its Packer players had little chance against a seasoned England team , but they 'd pulled back to 2-1 before this fourth Test in Sydney - only for the Nelson to rear its accursed head. The England spinners bowled them for 111 to win the match by 93 runs and retain the Ashes . 1996 The day Phil DeFreitas opened for England. Pinch-hitting was all the rage in advance of the World Cup , and though England promoted a glorified tailender , DeFreitas ' 17 , and a rumbustious 42-ball 55 from Graeme Hick , gave England the momentum to successfully chase South Africa 's 263 in Bloemfontein . 1903 South African opener Jack Siedle , born today , made his debut for South Africa in 1928. He scored a century in his sixth Test in Cape Town against England , who were his opponents in the first 13 of his 18 Tests. He was part of the 1935 side that won South Africa 's first Test in England - after trying for 28 years - at Lord 's but his only notable performance on the tour came in the first Test in Nottingham . The following series , against Australia at home , was his last and he scored two half-centuries - in Durban and Cape Town . 1927 Johnny Hayes was a tall right-arm bowler , who on his day was genuinely quick and could move the ball away from right-handers. He toured England under Walter Hadlee in 1949 , but a groin injury kept him out for half the series. The first of his 15 Tests came against England in 1950-51 and the following season he produced possibly his best burst when he removed Gomez , Walcott and Worrell in eight balls. In 1955-56 he toured India and Pakistan with success , taking 35 wickets at 32.11 in first-class games , where he used the new ball with skill. He was less successful in the Tests , his 13 wickets in six outings costing 46.61. He quit cricket in 1961 and served as Morocco 's honorary consul general in New Zealand until his retirement in 2004 . 1971 In his second Test , Sri Lankan medium-pacer Sajeewa de Silva , born today , took 5 for 85 against India in Colombo , a performance he could n't replicate in the rest of his brief career. His one-day career was longer , but he never took more than three wickets in a match. In 2007 , he was a contender for Chaminda Vaas ' place in the Test side but lost out to Farveez Maharoof .
