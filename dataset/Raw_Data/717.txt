Â© AP Sydney : Injured Australian skipper Michael Clarke , nursing a hamstring injury , has hinted at the possibility of both him and Steven Smith featuring together in the World Cup despite having similar roles in the team . Clarke has been given a February 21 deadline by Cricket Australia ( CA ) to make himself available to captain the team for the mega event , starting February 14 . Clarke 's recent international activity has been hampered by prolonged fitness problems that forced him to partially miss the India-Australia Test series recently. Smith led the side in his absence . " It 's about trying to pick the best 11 players , " Clarke was quoted as saying by news.com.au on Monday . " I do n't think it 's about any individual. There 's roles to play for every player. You know your strengths. " Earlier , critics and experts had questioned how Clarke and Smith could be in the side together , if Clarke declares himself fit , as they had similar batting styles and roles in the team. Both are right handed middle-order batsmen . Clarke , however , said his only concern right now was to get fit as quickly as possible and get on the field of play . " Right now , for me it 's about getting fit , about getting back on the park. Once I 've done that , the selectors will work out what 's the best XI and we 'll go with that , " he added .
