Delhi Daredevils crash to ninth straight loss Santosh Suri Santosh Suri,TNN | May 26 , 2014 , 08.46 AM IST Kings XI Punjab were determined to go into the playoffs with winning momentum intact. ( PTI Photo ) RELATED MOHALI : It was a mismatch between teams at the extreme ends of the spectrum. A match with no consequence , more so for Delhi Daredevils , who were destined to finish at the bottom of the points tally . Even then , one would have expected them to play for pride and end their campaign on a high by jolting table-toppers Kings XI Punjab in their den. But DD had no stomach for a fight as they were comprehensively beaten by seven wickets and 6.1 overs to spare . After being inserted , DD just could not last the full quota of 20 overs and were bundled out for mere 115 , with skipper Kevin Pietersen being the only noteworthy contributor with a well-compiled half-century . The home team overhauled the target with fair degree of comfort despite losing Virender Sehwag and Glenn Maxwell cheaply as inform Manan Vohra and David Miller completed the formality with consummate ease . If Kings XI Punjab would have wavered , one could have pardoned them as they would have been distracted by the daunting task of facing Kolkata Knight Riders at the overflowing Eden Gardens in the First Qualifier against Kolkata Knight Riders on Tuesday . But to their credit they remained focused on the job on hand and were determined to go into the playoffs with winning momentum intact . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Virender Sehwag,Kings XI Punjab,Kevin Pietersen,Glenn Maxwell,Delhi Daredevils Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
