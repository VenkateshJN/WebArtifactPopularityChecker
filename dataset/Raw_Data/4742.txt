( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 AUCKLAND : Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq became the first batsman to score 5,000 one-day international runs without any individual century when he reached the landmark against South Africa in a World Cup match in Auckland on Saturday . Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 The 40-year-old Misbah was only seven runs shy of 5,000 before the start of the Pool B clash at Eden Park . A single steered through midwicket off Pakistan-born leg-spinner Imran Tahir saw Misbah , batting at number four , go to 5,000 ODI runs in his 147th innings in 160 matches at this level . Misbah , often criticised for slow scoring , came into this match averaging over 43 in ODIs with a highest score of 96 not out against the West Indies at The Oval during the 2013 Champions Trophy in England . However , he belied his reputation by equalling West Indies ' great Vivian Richards 's all-time record for the fastest Test century with a 56-ball ton against Australia in Abu Dhabi in November last year .
