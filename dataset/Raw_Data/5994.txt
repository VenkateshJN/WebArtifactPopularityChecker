But , his career also involved controversies , records , failures , etc which all put together can be made into a Hollywood blockbuster. As a youngster , Gibbs started his career with St Joseph 's Marist College and then shifted to Diocesan College in Rondebosch. He was a very gifted athlete , who used to play rugby , cricket and soccer in school . Gibbs made his ODI debut against Kenya in October 1996. Even though he was an opening batsman , he started his international career in the middle-order. It took him a while to get used to the needs of international cricket. He did not score a 50 or a 100 in the first 19 ODIs , but once he got his first in the 20th , it all started to flow. He scored 21 hundreds in 248 games for the Proteas , which is still the highest by a South African. Scoring 8094 runs , he is also the second highest run-scorer for his country , just behind Jacques Kallis. The innings that will be remembered the most is , when chasing 434 set by Australia at Johannesburg , Gibbs got the hosts off to a flier and scored 175 off 111 balls to set-up a famous victory . Knowing all about his explosions in the shorter form of the game , the selectors were prompted to give him a chance in the Test arena as well. During the 1996 tour to India , Gibbs got his first Test cap in the second game at Eden Gardens , Kolkata. The first century he scored was a double hundred against New Zealand at Christchurch in 1999. He went onto score 13 more tons in Test and ended with a run aggregate of 6167 in 90 games at an average of 41.95 . Every cricketer goes through a lean period , Gibbs ' came during the 2006-07 season. Poor series against England and West Indies , triggered the team management to demote him down the order. He found some form while batting in the middle-order but he never made a big score. It had been more than two years since he had scored a hundred , he came close on 4 occasions , but could not convert the 90s into a ton . After being dropped in 2009 , Gibbs promised that he would go back to domestic cricket , score runs and make it to the side by the 2011 World Cup but things did not pan out the way he wanted. He last played for South Africa in 2010. Since then , he has been playing franchise cricket all over the world. He has represented several teams , some of them are Hyderabad , Mumbai , Perth Scorchers , Khulna Royal Bengals , St Lucia Zouks . Controversies and Gibbs went hand in hand. In 2001 , he and several of his team-mates were fined for smoking marijuana during the tour of West Indies. He was also involved in the match-fixing controversy with Hansie Cronje , he was reportedly offered $ 15 , 000 to score less than 20 runs in the third ODI against India. But he explained to King Commission that he did not keep up to his end of the bargain as he scored 74 in that match. As a result he was banned for only six months. Gibbs was also found guilty in making racist comments against Pakistan in 2007. His words that had been picked up from the stump microphone were \ " go back to the zoo \ " . He later told that it was directed to the crowd who had been abusing team-mate Paul Harris. However , the Pakistan Board made an official complaint and Gibbs was banned for two Tests. He appealed against the ban which was rejected by Richie Benaud who was ICC 's code of conduct commissioner. The ban was then changed into one Test , one T20I and one ODI - all against Pakistan . Interesting Facts : Gibbs is also famous for dropping a crucial catch in the 1999 World Cup. He tried to celebrate Steve Waugh 's wicket by throwing the ball in the air before he had complete control , he eventually dropped it and Waugh went onto score an unbeaten 120. At that time it was said that Waugh sledged Gibbs by stating , \ " You 've just dropped the World Cup \ " . Gibbs is also the second South African to score more than 1000 runs in World Cups , once again behind Jacques Kallis . Gibbs also became the first player to hit 6 sixes in an over in ODIs. He achieved this feet in a World Cup game against Netherlands in 2007 . Gibbs also took 108 catches in ODIs and 94 in Tests . by Akshay Maanay
