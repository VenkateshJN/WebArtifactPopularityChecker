( PTI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 HYDERABAD : Making the most of the largesse of the Cape Cobra fielders , Aiden Blizzard powered Hobart Hurricanes to a six-wicket win in their Group B match of the CLT20 on Sunday . Blizzard was dropped by Aviwe Mgijima when he was on 36 off skipper Justin Ontong . The southpaw , who had another reprieve when he was caught off a no-ball on 52 , punished the Cobras to help the Hurricanes post their first win of the tournament as they made 186 for four in 19 overs . Blizzard remained unbeaten on 78 off 48 balls with three fours and five sixes and Jonathan Wells was on 17. The duo shared an unbeaten 65-run stand for the fifth wicket with Blizzard scoring 45 of those . Earlier , Cape Cobras got off to a brisk start but lost a few quick wickets. However , big hitting Richard Levi kept the momentum going with a typical quickfire 42 off 30 balls . Later , the seventh-wicket pair of Robin Peterson and Vernon Philander hit some lusty blows to take the score to a competitive 184 for six . Philander remained unconquered on 32 off 14 balls with five fours and a six , while Peterson was on 25 off 14 balls with two fours and a six .
