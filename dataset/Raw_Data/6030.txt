Mature Rohit steers India through expertly Bangladesh vs India , 2nd Quarter-Final Thu , Mar 19 2015 by CB staff It was a coming of age innings for Rohit Sharma said a few commentators after the opener 's splendid 126-ball 137 in the quarterfinal against Bangladesh. It was a mature innings for sure. An innings that saw India recover from a dicey situation - they were 115/3 after 28 overs - and eventually post a challenging 302/6 . He paced his innings beautifully. He looked to hold one end up when that was the need of the hour and stitched together a superb partnership with Raina. " He controlled the first 25 overs , " said Raina later. He got his fifty off 70 balls and raced to 100 off the net 38 balls. He then proceeded to strike at a rate of 200 after getting to the hundred. Clearly , there was a lot of thought going behind the knock. He chose the right moments to attack and did not get bogged down when the pressure was on . A model innings from an opener who is growing in stature. Another factor that stood out was that he did not get out after scoring a hundred. In fact , that has been a standout feature of his batting for some time now. His last few scores over hundred have been 141 * , 209 , 264 , 138 and 137 today. When the opener goes on to score a big hundred , it always sets up the game up nicely for the team and Rohit 's knocks have been invaluable for India. He had a slice of luck on 90 when he was wrongly adjudged caught off a no ball but that takes away little from a splendid effort . Having played over 130 ODIs now , Rohit is finally carving a niche for himself as a solid opener who can score the big hundreds. Each big knock only increases his confidence and stature. Performing so well in the knockout stages of a World Cup must rank very high for the man himself. India could not have asked for better .
