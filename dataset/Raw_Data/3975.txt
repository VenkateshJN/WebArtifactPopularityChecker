( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 ABU DHABI : Pakistan skipper Misbah-ul Haq equalled the 28-year-old record for the fastest Test century when he hit one off 56 balls on the fourth day of the second Test against Australia in Abu Dhabi on Sunday . The record for the fastest Test hundred in terms of balls faced was set by West Indian legend Viv Richards , against England at Antigua in 1986 , who also took 56 balls . Misbah earlier smashed the fastest Test half-century record before lunch , reaching the figure off just 21 balls . That beat the previous record held by South Africa 's Jacques Kallis scored against Zimbabwe at Cape Town in 2004 . Misbah hit two bounadaries off paceman Mitchell Starc to reach his hundred , and punched the air in delight . This is also the second fastest hundred in terms of time , behind Australia 's Jack Gregory who reached a hundred after 70 minutes batting against South Africa at Johannesburg in 1921 . Misbah took 74 minutes to reach the mark. Misbah cut loose after Younis Khan fell for 46 , hitting three sixes and a four off one Steven Smith over and then hit the spinner for his fourth six an over later. In all he hit four boundaries and as many sixes . Misbah pushed Starc for three to complete the fastest Test fifty ever which took only 24 minutes . The previous fastest fifty in terms of time was held by Bangladesh 's Mohammad Ashraful who took 27 minutes for his fifty against India at Dhaka in 2007 . That helped Pakistan to declare their second innings at 293/3 , setting a mammoth 603-run target for Australia to win the match . Pakistan , who have not won a Test series against Australia since beating them 1-0 at home in 1994 , won the first Test by 221 runs in Dubai . The previous fastest Test half-century by a Pakistani batsman was by Shahid Afridi who took 26 balls to reach the mark , against India at Bangalore in 2005 . Majid Khan previously held the record for the fastest hundred by a Pakistani , scoring it off 74 balls against New Zealand in Karachi in 1976 .
