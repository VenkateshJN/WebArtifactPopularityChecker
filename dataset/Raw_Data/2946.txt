Bangladesh also made a couple of changes , drafting in Imrul Kayes and Arafat Sunny for Anamul Haque and Nasir Hossain . " The pitch looks good , a drop-in , with short boundary on one side , " Morgan said at the toss . " Hopefully it will do a bit this morning and we can make early inroads , " said the Irishman , confirming Hales will bat at number three . England , who face Afghanistan in their final pool match , can not afford to lose but Morgan denied there was extra pressure on his team . " There is always pressure in every game that we play. We prepare for games like this. It 's pretty simple for us , we win these two games and we go through. " Bangladesh , who play New Zealand in their final group fixture , will qualify for the quarter-finals if they beat England and captain Mashrafe Mortaza said he did not mind batting first . " The pitch looks good , the atmosphere is fine. We will do our best , " he said . Teams : England : Eoin Morgan ( Capt. ) , Moeen Ali , Ian Bell , Alex Hales , Joe Root , James Taylor , Josh Buttler , Chris Woakes , Chris Jordan , Stuart Broad , James Anderson .
