Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 Wahab Riaz was the most successful bowler for Pakistan , returning figures of 3/54 , while there were two wickets apiece for Sohail Khan and Rahat Ali . Opting to bat after winning the toss , Porterfield led by example and defied the Pakistani bowlers with elan at the Adelaide Oval . But even as the Irish skipper stood firm , other top batsmen such as Paul Stirling , Ed Joyce and Niall O'Brien failed to prosper . Porterfield emerged as lone ranger with the others throwing away their wickets at regular intervals . That he had only two stands of 48 runs each , with Andy Balbirnie ( 18 ) and Gary Wilson ( 29 ) for the fourth and fifth wicket respectively , indicate that Porterfield badly lacked support from the other end . Having won three out of their last five matches in the ongoing tournament , Ireland came into this final game with high hopes of making a maiden quarterfinal appearance in the quadrennial extravaganza . Porterfield showed the right intent , mixing caution with aggression enroute to his seventh ODI hundred , but the others left a lot to be desired . He found the fence 11 times and cleared it once during his 131-ball knock . The Irish captain , though , was lucky to have survived a scare when he was batting on 99 , as Rahat Ali failed to hold onto a catch off his own bowling. Porterfield played an uppish drive but the ball burst through Rahat 's hands , allowing the batsman to come back for two runs and reach the three-figure mark . For the record , there was another return catch dropped later in the innings , by Riaz when he was up against John Mooney .
