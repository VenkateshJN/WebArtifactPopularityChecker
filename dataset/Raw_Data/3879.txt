Kiwis hand South Africa a sound thrashing The author has posted comments on this article Dwaipayan Datta , TNN | Feb 12 , 2015 , 10.52AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 CHRISTCHURCH : The New Zealand team left the Hagley Oval on a beautiful Wednesday afternoon with a happy feeling. They have been one of the in-form teams leading up to the World Cup , beating teams like Pakistan and Sri Lanka in back-to-back ODI series. And when it came to South Africa in the final practice match , the result was the same . South Africa were without Dale Steyn and Hashim Amla and the intensity was definitely less , but the margin of 134 runs ca n't be overlooked. The beauty of this New Zealand side is that it does n't have superstars but all are competent players who can rise to the occasion . Be it the opening burst of Brendon McCullum ( 59 off 48 balls ) , the middle-order solidity of Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor or the allround abilities of Corey Anderson , it is difficult to find a flaw in New Zealand 's performance . And when it came to bowling , the swing of Trent Boult ( 5-53 ) and the use of flight and loop by the wily old Daniel Vettori ( 2-29 ) did n't give South Africa any chance after the Kiwis had put up 331 on the board . Brief Scores : New Zealand 331-8 in 50 overs ( McCullum 59 , Williamson 66 ; Abbott 2-35 ) beat South Africa 197 in 44.2 ovs ( Duminy 80 ; Boult 5-53 , Vettori 2-29 ) NZ won by 134 runs .
