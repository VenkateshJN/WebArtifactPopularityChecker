Saurashtra finally come good as a team The author has posted comments on this article Shweta Singh , TNN | Jan 24 , 2015 , 09.23PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 AHMEDABAD : For any team , to win a solitary match in seven outings in Ranji Trophy tournament is poor by any standards. It is all the more sad that this very statistics is about a team like Saurasthra , finalist of last year Ranji Trophy . Says a lot about what the team looks like. Year 2014-15 may well be one of poorest for Saurasthra as they have won just one match so far , losing two and drawing four ( conceding first-innings lead in all 4 ) . With the help of off-spinner Kamlesh Makvana , Saurashtra defeated Haryana on Friday in Rajkot , much to the respite of many , including coach Sithanshu Kotak who is in his maiden year in this job . But numbers can be dangerously deceptive. Consider this : Saurashtra 's Sheldon Jackson , with 788 runs in 12 innings with average of 78.80 , is the highest run-getter in Ranji this year so far. He has smashed three tons and as many fifties and his strike rate is 60.24 , one of the best among toppers . But lack of support from the opposite end always let his hard work down. Saurashtra 's problem this season has been failure of teamwork. Individual performances galore , this team 's batting or balling failed to live up to the billing. The only time they did so , resulted in an impressive 62-run win over Haryana . This win takes them to 10 points , two more than Odisha who are now lying at the bottom. With Saurashtra taking on Odisha in their final league stage encounter , the onus is on Saurashtra to humble Odisha and stay clear of relegation to Group C .
