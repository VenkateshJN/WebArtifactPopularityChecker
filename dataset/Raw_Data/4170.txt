Rohit Sharma hits 264 in big Indian victory The author has posted comments on this article Archiman Bhaduri , TNN | Nov 14 , 2014 , 11.44AM IST Rohit Sharma has now scored a century in all three formats of the game at the Eden Gardens. ( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 KOLKATA : Given a chance , Rohit Sharma would love to carry the Eden Gardens pitch in his bag. A world record 264 against Sri Lanka in the fourth ODI on Thursday gave the elegant right-hander the unique distinction of having scored a century in all three formats of the game at this historic venue . The Mumbai batsman announced his return to international cricket -after being out with an injury since August -with an innings of pure class. Rohit , who also became the first man in the history of the game to score two double centuries in ODI cricket , helped India thrash Sri Lanka by 153 runs . India now have a 4-0 lead in the five-match series. Turbo-charged by Rohit 's 173-ball 264 and Virat Kohli 's polished 64-ball 66 , India amassed 404/5 in their 50 overs after the latter won the toss and elected to bat . It was India 's fifth 400-plus total in this format of the game and it left Sri Lanka with a near impossible chase. Rohit , however , did not make a fluent start. He looked a bit rusty in the initial stages of his innings and was lucky to survive a dropped chance when Thisara Perera put down a straightforward chance at third man off Shaminda Eranga in the fifth over . Rohit , who only had four runs against his name at that stage , did not look back. He concentrated on building his innings , reaching his 50 off 72 balls before changing gear and taking charge. His next 50 runs came off only 28 balls , while he raised his 150 off 125 balls . By this time he was hitting boundaries and sixes almost at will and raced to his second double century in only 151 balls. He was dismissed off the last ball of the innings , leaving Virender Sehwag 's 219 against West Indies in Indore in 2011 a distant second . The islanders made four changes in their line-up , bringing in Dinesh Chandimal , Lahiru Thirimanne , Shaminda Eranga and Ajantha Mendis in place of Kumar Sangakkara , Ashyan Priyanjan , Chaturanga de Silva and Lahiru Gamage , but it failed to make any difference to their fortunes. Their bowlers continued to be wayward and their catching and ground fielding was at best club class . India 's new-ball bowlers Umesh Yadav and Stuart Binny , who come in place of the rested Ishant Sharma , made early inroads into the Lankan innings , reducing them to 484 by the 10th over . Dhawal Kulkarni provided the finishing touches , picking up four wickets for 34 in his 10 overs as Lanka were bowled out for 251 in 43.1 overs. However , spinners Axar Patel and debutant Karn Sharma went for a few runs . Earlier , Rohit shared a 202-run third wicket partnership with skipper Kohli ( 66 ) and further 128 for the fifth wicket with Robin Uthappa ( 16 not out ) , who replaced rested Wriddhiman Saha , to leave the Lankans completely demoralised . Kohli too enjoyed his time in the middle and the duo milked 57 runs in the second Powerplay taken in the 30th over. But an unfortunate mix up between the two saw Kohli being run out for 66 , which came off 64 balls . Rohit 's run-riot smashes records and Sri Lanka Returning to the Indian team after an injury lay-off , opener Rohit Sharma hit 264 in the 4th ODI against Sri Lanka. Entire Lankan team dismissed for 251 - 13 less than Rohit 's score - chasing India 's 404/5 . Rohit 's knock highest in ODIs , 45 more than previous highest - Sehwag 's 219 vs Windies . Only cricketer to score 2 ODI double tons ( Rohit hit 209 vs Australia at Indore in 2013 ) . Highest score by an Indian in any limited overs game , surpassing Shikhar Dhawan 's 248 against South Africa 'A ' at Pretoria in 2013. But fell short of world record 268 by Ali Brown for Surrey vs Glamorgan . 173-ball knock included record 33 fours. Also had 9 sixes , making for record 42 boundaries . Before 2010 , no batsman had hit 200 in 2,961 ODIs. It has happened on 4 occasions since then , each time by an Indian ( Rohit , Sehwag , Tendulkar ) in India. When Sehwag and Sachin scored their double tons , India won by 153 runs --the same margin as on Thursday .
