The 22-year-old Haque suffered the injury while fielding during his side 's six-wicket victory over Scotland at Saxton Oval in Nelson . He had scans at a local hospital and a team spokesman said at the time he had dislocated his shoulder but it was too early to determine how much time he would miss . It typically takes about three months of rehabilitation on if surgery is not required and officials confirmed on Friday he would take no further part in the tournament . The 28-year-old Imrul has played 53 ODIs , scoring 1,390 runs at just under 27 with one century and 10 half-centuries . His last ODI for Bangladesh was against Zimbabwe last November . Bangladesh have five points from four games and are fourth in Pool A , occupying the final place for the quarter-finals . They play England on Monday in Adelaide in a match that could decide the fourth qualifier from Pool A. They then travel back to New Zealand to meet the World Cup co-hosts at Seddon Park in Hamilton on March 13 in their final pool match .
