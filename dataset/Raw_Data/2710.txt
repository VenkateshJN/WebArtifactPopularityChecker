McCullum , 33 , led the Kiwis to their first World Cup final where they did lose to Australia by seven wickets at a packed MCG on March 29 but won a million fans with their entertaining show throughout the 50-over showpiece event . With 328 runs in nine matches at a strike rate of 188.50 , McCullum led by example to be named captain of the ICC 's team of the tournament . McCullum won the top award ahead of Kane Williamson , who claimed the Redpath Cup for first-class batting , and Trent Boult , who was the winner of the Winsor Cup for bowling . Williamson had a season to savour in 2014-15 and was recognised in winning the Twenty20 International Player of the Year , the ODI Player of the Year and the Test Player of the Year . But come April 8 and many of the Kiwi cricketers will be seen in their respective IPL colours with McCullum turning out for Chennai Super Kings .
