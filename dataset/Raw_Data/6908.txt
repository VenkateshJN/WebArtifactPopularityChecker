UAE v West Indies , World Cup 2015 , Group B , Napier March 14 , 2015 WI must beat UAE , weather and then watch Start time 1100 ( 2200 GMT ) Play 03 : 00 'Hoping Gayle can give us full day 's play ' - Ambrose Big picture This is what it has come down to. The group stage of the World Cup will end with two Full Members , West Indies and Pakistan , fighting for their spot in the knockout phase against two Associate Members , one of which is also in contention for the quarter finals . Their defeat to Ireland is why West Indies are hanging on by their fingernails in the first place and although they are not expected to slip up against much-less fancied UAE , even a win may not be enough. They need to win big ; enough for the net run-rate to remain ahead of the team that loses between Pakistan and Ireland , although it is already significantly better than the latter. It will mean they have to be switched on and clinical. They have to score quickly , whether they are batting first or chasing , and they have to be incisive . All of that should make UAE a little nervous , but if it has , they 're not showing it. They have only had one blow-out match , against India , and given the rest of the big teams a good run. UAE may not have looked like winning many games , but they have appeared stubborn. They do n't give their wickets away too easily and they bowl with good discipline so they make themselves difficult to push over. Despite all that , they have n't won a match yet and they want to change before they leave the tournament . One team desperate to go through , another desperate to go home with something to show. It has all the makings of a high-intensity match-up .
