( Agency Photo ) Page 1 of 4 ISLAMABAD : The Supreme Court of Pakistan has reinstated Najam Sethi as chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board just four days after a lower court replaced him with Zaka Ashraf . The Islamabad High Court on Saturday invalidated a prime minister 's special notification in February to appoint a management committee to the PCB , which later elected Sethi as the cricket board 's chairman . The Pakistan government filed a petition against High Court decision and a three-member bench of the Supreme Court on Wednesday suspended Saturday 's earlier decision . Supreme Court Judge Anwar Zaheer Jamali says the next hearing into the matter will be held on May 27 , but by that time Sethi will head the PCB and the cricket board 's management committee will also be functional .
