Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 Shehzad was then run out when his bat bounced up as he dived for the crease while completing a second run off Mohammad Naveed with Shaiman Anwar 's low flat throw catching the batsman out . The 23-year-old Shehzad , who had been dropped twice early in his innings , disconsolately trudged off having been in sight of the first century by a Pakistani batsman at the 2015 World Cup . He had opened the tournament with 47 against India , but scored one and a duck in his last two innings. He also had innings of two and five in Pakistan 's final warmup matches . Sohail scored 70 runs in the partnership with Shehzad before he fell during the batting power-play , which Pakistan had taken at the 30th over . Sohaib Maqsood ( 45 ) and Misbah ul-Haq ( 65 ) then combined for a 75-run partnership as Pakistan increased the tempo with the captain falling in the 49th over , as Manjula Guruge ( 4-56 ) took two wickets in two balls . UAE captain Mohammad Tauqir had chosen to field after winning the toss , going against conventional wisdom on the ground considered the best batting wicket in New Zealand . Pakistan 's batsmen , however , made slow progress against a non-threatening UAE attack before the final few overs . The 1992 champions need to win the match to remain in contention for the quarter-finals after losing their first two games of the tournament and then struggling to beat Zimbabwe .
