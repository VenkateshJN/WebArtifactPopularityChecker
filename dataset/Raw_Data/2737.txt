( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 HAMILTON : Indian batting legend Sunil Gavaskar slammed the England team for its embarrassingly early exit from the World Cup , calling it an overrated side in not just cricket but football also . Bangladesh on Monday knocked out England from the mega event with a 15-run win to set up a likely clash with defending champions India in the quarterfinals . Gavaskar was far from being impressed after England folded for 260 runs in 48.3 overs . " I think it would have been easier playing England in the quarters. Look at their form. England have won only one game , they are a nothing side. Every time there is a World Cup football , everyone speaks how they will do this and that but at the end of the day , they are just an overrated team both in cricket and football , " Gavaskar told NDTV . Put into bat , Bangladesh rode on Mahmudullah 's resilient century to post 275 for seven and then put up a spirited bowling show to pack England for 260 runs in 48.3 overs in a thrilling group-A contest .
