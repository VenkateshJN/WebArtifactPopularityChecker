World Cup 2015 : Atkinson inspects SCG strip , chats with Duncan Fletcher The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Mar 23 , 2015 , 01.35PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 SYDNEY : The pitch at the Sydney Cricket Ground ( SCG ) has attracted so much attention in the past few days that ICC 's chief of grounds and pitches committee Andy Atkinson was seen carrying out thorough inspection of the 22-yard strip on Monday . There has been a lot of speculation about the nature of the track for the semifinal between India and Australia on Thursday . The Australian cricket team , very carefully through their players , have spelt it that it wo n't be a track offering help for spinners with Glenn Maxwell " expecting fair amount of grass on the wicket " and James Faulkner denying that Sri Lankans were bamboozled by Imran Tahir and JP Duminy . Atkinson 's role has become more significant as a lot will depend on what kind of instructions he gives to the local groundsmen including head curator Tom Parker Jr . When Indians came for practice in the morning session , the quartet of Ravi Shastri , Mahendra Singh Dhoni , Bharat Arun and Arshad Ayub straightaway went to inspect the strip while coach Duncan Fletcher quietly walked towards Atkinson to share a few words . It wo n't be known as to what India 's coach asked but he would definitely seek a few inputs about the behavioral pattern of the strip during Thursday 's semifinal . It has been learnt that the pitch that will be used for the match is the same one on which South Africa humbled West Indies putting a total in excess of 400 runs . On a different strip used for quarterfinals , it was a reverse result with leg-spinner Imran Tahir picking up four wickets and off-spinner JP Duminy scalped three wickets .
