World Cup 2015 : Williamson fit but Milne forces New Zealand into first change The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Mar 12 , 2015 , 12.21PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 HAMILTON : New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum declared Kane Williamson fit to face Bangladesh on Friday but injured fast bowler Adam Milne is unlikely to play , forcing their first change of the World Cup . Left-arm paceman Mitchell McClenaghan is likely to replace Milne in what would be the first game for one of the four other members of the Black Caps squad who warmed the bench as the hosts racked up five wins in five Pool A games . Key batsman Williamson was one of the players struck down by gastroenteritis during the week . " Most of the guys have been fine in term of illness , " said McCullum on Thursday. " Milne , we want to have a look in the morning as he is still a little bit stiff. " Asked if McClenaghan would replace Milne , who has a bruised shoulder , McCullum replied : " It 's fair to assume that. " McCullum said Williamson is keen to play even though New Zealand are already through to the quarterfinals . " I think so , he ( Williamson ) is here today hitting balls and it 's hard to keep him down for too long. He 'll be in there indoors for a good 3-4 hours no doubt , knowing Kane. He seems fine , " said McCullum , who said Daniel Vettori and Grant Elliott had also suffered stomach trouble . " It is what it is. If half the team goes down you ca n't do anything about it . " You ca n't wrap the team up in cotton wool. You just have to get on with it. They 're the cards that fall in your hand and you find a way to play them. I 'm confident the guys on the bench will play well and give us a good chance. " Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
