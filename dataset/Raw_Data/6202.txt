Yuvraj Singh ; Zaheer Khan ; Gautam Gambhir ; Varun Aaron ; Dinesh Karthik ; Murli Vijay... they all shd be taken into the consideration. They all deserves chance to show their mettle against Shikhar Dhawan ; Bhuvneshwar Kumar ; Ravindra Jadeja ; Ambati Rayudu Posted by on ( January 7 , 2015 , 10 : 31 GMT ) this india team only dnt want to win the WC bcz..only heroes of winning 2011 out for wc 2015.. . Posted by on ( January 7 , 2015 , 10 : 15 GMT ) I think YUVI would be the best option than RAYUDU . Posted by on ( January 7 , 2015 , 8 : 25 GMT ) I think Murali Vijay would be a better option than Dhawan . MORE CARTOONS
