The 58-year-old was under fire following England 's poor performance in the last few months , especially a first-round exit in the World Cup where they also lost to Bangladesh . " The existing England team set-up will change with immediate effect , with Paul Downton leaving his position as managing director of England Cricket , " an ECB statement said . " A new leadership appointment , focused on performance will now be created and report directly to the chief executive. " The former England wicketkeeper was apparently behind Kevin Pietersen 's axing early last year following a 5-0 Ashes whitewash . Tom Harrison , chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board , shed more light on the situation : " The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to. The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world class performance is at the heart of everything we do , " he said . " Paul is a man of great integrity who has worked extremely hard to make a difference at the ECB. He joined at a very difficult time , but under his leadership the Test team have made significant strides. We thank him for his hard work , drive and determination and wish him every success for the future. " The English cricket team is currently in the West Indies to play a three-Test series. " The touring team in the West Indies are aware of the changes. The process for appointing the new role , with sole responsibility for the England set-up , will begin immediately , " Harrison added . © Cricbuzz ( with inputs from agencies )
