CLT20 : Time for Mumbai Indians to deliver The author has posted comments on this article Santosh Suri , TNN | Sep 16 , 2014 , 11.58AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 RAIPUR : Super Tuesday will decide which two teams will go into the main round of the CLT20. As of now , mathematically all four sides are in contention . Northern Knights , with two wins and the best net run rate , are favourites to bag one of qualifying berths. So , it will be either Mumbai Indians or Lahore Lions taking the second spot , with Southern Express almost certain to miss the bus . Monday 's rest day gave the teams time not only time to recuperate but also rethink their strategies , especially Lahore Lions , who , after being so impressive in their win against Mumbai Indians , were mauled by Knights on Sunday . However , Lions can still hope to get into the main round as they take on bottom-placed Express , who have been the least impressive side , having lost both their matches . On the other hand , Mumbai Indians have a tough encounter against Knights. However , by the time they take the field , they will know exactly what they will require to get into the tournament proper . Undoubtedly , Mumbai Indians will approach their last match in a positive frame of mind. They owe it to their openers Lendl Simmons and Michael Hussey , who set up the big win against Express . Mumbai Indians still have issues with their bowling and fielding , with their skipper Kieron Pollard admitting " if we field and bowl like this against bigger sides , they will kill us " . Without doubt , MI will have to raise their game many notches against a quality side like Knights . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
