Last updated on Thursday , 19 February , 2015 , 04 : 54 AM Haddin admits Australia think-tank mulling different bowling combinations Australia unsure of what to expect from the pitch after the covers on the ground are removed Michael Clarke certain to return against Bangladesh © Getty Australia are unsure of the team that should take the field against Bangladesh in Brisbane on Saturday because of tropical Cyclone Marcia. The Gabba is expected to be soaked in water before Saturday and the match itself could be affected. This has put Australia 's think-tank in a quandary admits wicket-keeper Brad Haddin . " All the weather has done has delayed the naming of the team. We are not sure what we are going to get when we pull the covers up , " said Haddin after the Australian team was forced to hold all their practice sessions indoors . One possibility is to have a four-pronged pace attack with Pat Cummins joining the trio of Mitchell Johnson , Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood who all played against England. Australia are now unsure of what to expect from the pitch and Haddin explained why this delayed Australia from taking a call on the final eleven . " Yeah , there is a possibility. If there was n't any of this weather around then that probably would have been slim. But it 's hard to give you a team or what we are thinking because we are so unsure on what is going to happen with the weather and when they pull the covers up , " he said . While the bowling combination remains a mystery , Haddin stressed that there were no such doubts regarding Michael Clarke 's return. Clarke had been sidelined due to a hamstring injury but was declared fit for the game against Bangladesh . " This was the plan for Michael all along , for him to be right for this game , " said Haddin . Clarke is also expected to take up stand-in skipper George Bailey 's spot in the eleven despite speculations of all-rounder Shane Watson sitting out . © Cricbuzz ( with inputs from agencies ) Tags
