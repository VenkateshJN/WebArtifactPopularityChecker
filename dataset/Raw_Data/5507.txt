Put in to bat by Preston Mommsen , England secured a big total and then took regular wickets to bowl Scotland out for 184 to claim victory by 119 runs. They should have gotten a lot more than 303 for 8 after an opening stand of 172 - their best in nearly a decade - in 30.1 overs , but in the end that proved more than enough. Leading with the ball was Steven Finn , who bounced back from a horrible outing against New Zealand with 3 for 26 in nine overs . Driving England 's superb start was Moeen Ali with his second ODI century , and the tenth by an Englishman in World Cups , but after his dismissal England crawled through the batting Powerplay and lost wickets at the death , including three in the last nine balls. Adding to England 's total were 21 extras , of which 15 were wides . With cloud cover overhead , Scotland had a good chance of striking early but were let down by young pace bowler Josh Davey , who bowled four wides in his opening over and in his second was driven and cut for two fours and a six by Ali. Iain Wardlaw was tidier with an opening spell of 4-1-15-0 but the pressure was eased by World Cup debutant Alasdair Evans , who after rapping Bell 's pads second ball , gave Ali room to cut and pull. The horse had bolted . Bell was far from fluent , 32 deliveries separating his first and second boundaries , but England ticked away thanks to Ali 's free-scoring methods. The left-handed batsman crunched drives , cuts and pulls with authority and when offspinner Majid Haq erred in length , was quick to swing him over long-on for six. Richie Berrington was driven with a lovely follow-through for six more , then swung behind square leg to put 100 on the board for England in the 17th over. His century needed 91 balls , reached with Ali 's fourth six . Bell was Scotland 's first success in the 31st over , for 54 off 85 balls , driving Berrington to cover. Ali went next , sweeping offspinner Haq to the deep for 128 from 106 deliveries , which had left England at at 201 with eight wickets and 15.3 overs left , but Scotland hit back through Evans and Davey. Gary Ballance dragged a loose prod at Evans onto his stumps for 10 to start the batting Powerplay with a wicket-maiden , and Davey had Joe Root caught behind for 1 with the first ball of a new spell - a peach that straightened off a lovely line to take the edge . Eoin Morgan , with four ducks in his six previous ODI innings , took ten balls to open his account and them hurried onwards by cracking Wardlaw for six and four. A terrific stumping by Matthew Cross off Davey accounted for James Taylor , but the arrival of Buttler changed England 's mood. The pair added 45 in 23 balls to lift visions of 320 , but the wickets of Buttler ( 24 off 14 balls ) , Morgan ( 46 off 42 ) and Chris Woakes dented all that. Davey struck twice in the 50th over to end with 4 for 68 , a big improvement after he went for 20 in his first two overs . Chasing 304 , Scotland lost three wickets inside 12 overs - James Anderson , Chris Woakes and Steven Finn struck early - but were given hopes by Kyle Coetzer , who struck some sumptuous fours in an attractive 84-ball 71 - the pick of which was a ferocious back-foot punch off Anderson - after being dropped by Bell at second slip on 4 . Coetzer 's first 35 runs took 27 balls , but his next 15 came off 37 as Finn kept a check on the runs. Finn 's tall frame , allied with an accurate line , ensured he did n't concede a single boundary in his first spell of 5-1-12-1 ( he bled 49 in two overs in Wellington ) , and Ali 's offspin dried up runs too. It was he who claimed Coetzer , lofting to long-on amid a flurry of boundaries , and Berrington in successive overs to snap Scotland 's fightback. Finn 's second spell ticked off the wickets of Davey and Cross and the end came when Haq top-edged Woakes to deep backward square leg in the 43rd over . Brief scores : England 303 for 8 in 50 overs ( Moeen Ali 128 , Ian Bell 54 , Josh Davey 4/68 ) beat Scotland 184 in 42.2 overs ( Kyle Coetzer 71 , Steven Finn 3/26 ) by 119 runs . © Cricbuzz Tags
