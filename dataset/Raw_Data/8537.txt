Karki stars in Nepal triumph Mukasa ’ s all-round effort in vain as Uganda goes down by 62 runs in title clash Nepal defeated Uganda by 62 runs to register its fifth consecutive win of the tournament and win the ICC World Cricket League Division Three title 2014-15 . Bhuvan Karki , the left-arm spinner , starred with a four-wicket haul to help Nepal defeat Uganda by 62 runs in the final and win the ICC World Cricket League Division Three title 2014-15 at the Kinrara Academy Oval on Thursday ( October 30 ) . After Nepal was bowled out for 223 in 49.5 overs , Karki 's figures of 4 for 39 from eight overs sent Uganda crashing to 161 all out in 44.1 overs . Roger Mukasa 's 6 for 27 in 3.5 overs , which earned him the Man of the Match award , helped Uganda keep Nepal down to an attainable total. Mukasa , who finished with a tournament tally of 13 wickets from six matches to go with 265 runs at 44.16 , was also named the Man of the Series. Nepal started strongly after electing to bat , with Sagar Pun ( 64 ) and Naresh Budayair ( 51 ) putting on 107 for the opening wicket in 26.2 overs. Gyanendra Malla chipped in with 56 after the openers were dismissed , but found little support otherwise. Only Paras Khadka , the captain , managed to get to double figures apart from the top three , Mukara ’ s right-arm medium pace doing all the damage as Nepal lost its last six wickets for just 15 runs . Uganda suffered a setback when Mukasa was forced to retire hurt on 12 after having put on 23 with Arthur Kyobe for the first wicket. Hamu Bagenda then joined Kyobe and the duo put on a further 27 before Kyobe was removed for 15. Basant Regmi removed Bagneda ( 22 ) with the first ball of the next over and Uganda suddenly found itself in a spot. Mukasa returned with the score on 92 for 5 and added 49 with Frank Nsubuga , the captain. He eventually departed for a valiant 52-ball 51 , studded with four boundaries and three sixes. After that , Nepal quickly ran through the tail to seal its fifth consecutive win in the tournament . Regmi was impressive with the ball as well , his 9.1 overs fetching him figures of 2 for 29.
