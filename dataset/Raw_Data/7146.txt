IPL 2015 April 6 , 2015 The worst IPL teams and more A stats preview to the 2015 IPL season shares 26 Most successful team Chennai Super Kings have made it to the knock-out stages ( " final four " ) of the Indian Premier League in each of the seven previous editions , two times more than any other team. Prior to the 2014 edition , Super Kings had made four consecutive finals , winning two of those. They have played five finals in total , with no other team managing more than two such appearances. Super Kings have won 84 T20 matches in all , more than any other team in all T20 cricket , whether international or domestic. There is little doubt they have been the most successful T20 team in the format 's short history and probably come into the 2015 IPL as favourites despite an average 2014 campaign , even if only by their own standards , where the team lost a high-scoring Qualifier ( effectively a semi-final ) to Kings XI Punjab . Performance of Teams in the IPL - Snapshot Team/year * Deccan Chargers won the 2009 IPL and reached the Final-Four stage of the 2010 edition Least successful teams King 's XI have failed to make the final four in five of seven IPL tournaments. They made the final four in the first and last editions of the IPL , missing out on five consecutive occasions in between. The only other team that has failed to make the final four on five occasions is Rajasthan Royals. However , unlike Kings XI who have never won an IPL trophy , the Royals punched above their weight to be crowned Champions of the inaugural edition in 2008 . Delhi Daredevils have the poorest win-loss ratio among the eight teams who are set to be part of this IPL. They have an IPL win-loss ratio of 0.745 , having lost 59 matches and won only 44. Super Kings , in sharp contrast , have the best win-loss ratio ( 1.568 ) , having won 69 matches and lost only 44. However , unlike Kings XI and Royals who have only made the Final Four in two editions of the IPL , Daredevils have done so on three occasions. But again , Kings XI and Royals have made an IPL final on one occasion each , with the Daredevils never managing to make the title match despite reaching the Final Four on more occasions . Win-loss ratios of teams in the IPL Team 0.75 Losing streak Among the teams that have played in each of the seven editions so far , Daredevils are the only one that have n't made at least one IPL final. Adding to this ignominy is that fact that Daredevils are currently on a nine-match losing streak , having lost each of their last nine games in the 2014 edition. The record for the most consecutive IPL losses is 11 , suffered by Pune Warriors during the 2012 and 2013 editions. Daredevils will the hoping to avoid that record , and also worsening their overall T20 win-loss ratio ( 0.774 ) in the process , which is already 24th on the list of 30 teams that have played at least 100 T20s each . Knockout kings Knight Riders have won 80 % of their final four games in the IPL , a better record than even Super Kings ( 64 % ) , who are arguably the most successful T20 team of all time. Knight Riders have won four of their five final-four matches. Though Knight Riders have only made the final-four stage in three of the seven editions , they finished Champions in two of those campaigns ( 2012 and 2014 ) , the joint-most for any IPL team. Super Kings have two titles as well . Win percentages in the Final-Four stage of the IPL Team 0.00 Teams which played musical chairs Ten teams have played in more than one season of the IPL. Four out of these ten teams - Mumbai Indians , Knight Riders , Kings XI and Super Kings - have used less than nine new players per season. Five of the seven IPL titles have been won by these four teams. Each of the six remaining teams have used more than nine new players per season and shared only two IPL titles between them . Super Kings have only used 57 players over the course of seven IPL seasons , 16 fewer than any other team that has played in seven editions. Four out of the eight teams playing the 2015 IPL - Mumbai Indians , Knight Riders , Kings XI and Super Kings - have used less than nine new players per season. These four teams have played a total of 32 IPL games in the final-four stages of the tournament. The other four teams - Daredevil , Royal Challengers , Sunrisers and Royals - have cumulatively played only 16 final-four matches . Daredevils once again made wholesale changes at the 2015 auction , buying 14 new players , more than any team at this year 's auction. They will be hoping to buck the above trend and overcome their own poor form on the way to a successful 2015 campaign .

And its too early to predict the Winner , but my money is on Kings X1 Punjab , enjoy the title . __PK on April 9 , 2015 , 21 : 53 GMT Agree on the criticism of Final 4 win % . If this was a measure used in ODI World Cups , SA and NZ would be the two worst teams in history... probably... I have n't actually done the stats , but I 'm sure you can see what I mean. NZ would be 1 from 8-ish and SA none from 4 or 5 or something like that . on April 9 , 2015 , 9 : 49 GMT Many arguments about CSK are circular. They win because they have many international players. Indian players playing for csk get selected to the national team etc. The success is because of the management. many players were signed up for csk who became famous later. Bailey Holder Ashwin Mohit etc adi133 on April 8 , 2015 , 13 : 41 GMT Not at all surprised. When there is such a huge competition and the teams look almost at par with each other on paper , the thing that separates the top teams from the bottom ones is how well the players are synchronized with each other. CSK is the only team to have the same captian throughout the eight seasons. Added to that is the fact that they always had some of the best Indian players in their ranks. Delhi is the team that has shuffled themselves the most and their performance clearly indicates that . Crickleo on April 8 , 2015 , 13 : 14 GMT Ca n't help but love the IPL. I always viewed Mumbai , Chennai and Bangalore as the 3 heavyweights of the league but was surprised to see RCB poor history. Will never forget the golden period of RCB when Ross Taylor would come into a screaming crowd and slog sweep massive sixes over cow-corner , now he ca n't even find a team , very sad. . Karthi_2K11 on April 8 , 2015 , 12 : 46 GMT CSK are close to becoming the Man. U. of the IPL / CLT20 tournaments. Although , they have the same no. of titles ( 4 in total : 2 CLT20 & 2 IPL ) as Sydney Sixers ( SS ) ( if you count the erstwhile NSW as its predecessor ) , in the 7 years that IPL / & 6 years that CLT20 has been played ; they have reached the " semi-final " or knockout stage at least 10 of these 13 times ( 77 % success rate ) that both these tournaments have been held. ( except the '08 , '11 & '12 CLT20 ) . SS / NSW comes second , to this level of success. In 10 years of the BBL , they have reached the knockout stages 6 times , & went on to eventually win the tournament twice. They had been routed in the league stages four times in these 10 years. In the CLT20 , they had better fortune , because they reached the knockouts 3 times out of the six times it has been held , & went onto eventually win the title 2 times. So , SS / NSW has reached the knockout stages 9 times out of 16 times ( 56 % success rate ) they have appeared in T20 tournaments SooryaN on April 8 , 2015 , 10 : 17 GMT Chances of making their maiden IPl title is declining for RCB by excluding Dravid and continued till now by excluding Ranji heroes ( Karnataka team consecutively won 2 ranji and Irani trophy ) like Vinay , Karun nair , uthappa , Manish pandey , Binny , rahul , shreyas and Mayank agarwal on April 8 , 2015 , 9 : 45 GMT East Or West , Rajasthan is the Best... : ) on April 8 , 2015 , 8 : 12 GMT I dont think " win percentages in final four " will tell you anything new.The teams will look to qualify to the semis and then take their chances.kolkata has played only 5 and rajasthan 4 where as chennai has played 14 and mumbai 9 matches.It is unfair to compare the latter with the former.Kolkata has won 2 titles and mumbai only 1 but mumbai has won more matches and is consistently in top 4 since 2010 where as kkr appeared from 2011 ,2012 but missed out in 2013 .Mumbai is better than kkr on April 8 , 2015 , 8 : 12 GMT RCB will never improve until they give chance to local heroes ( karnataka ) .

If DD did n't change squad after last season , they would n't have better chance of winning ! It is common sense that winners wo n't change squads while losers will. However , the author tries to reinvent the wheel by relating the squad change with wins rather than wins to squad change ( which is intuitive ) . on April 8 , 2015 , 6 : 06 GMT @ Vamsi - I think they both are different teams , one represented Deccan region fully and another one just Hyderabad. Its like Manchester City and Manchester United , both of them from the same region but different owners. Or , you can say that Sunrisers does n't want to carry the legacy of Deccan . on April 8 , 2015 , 5 : 51 GMT thanks for updated data post on April 8 , 2015 , 5 : 26 GMT ur stats r wrong deccan chargers hyderabad won 2009 edition : P Yorkermaster on April 8 , 2015 , 3 : 43 GMT I 'm surprised with the results of RCB over the past three seasons. They had a very strong team. ABD and Gayle have produced some of the magnificent individual performances of IPL in this period. Still they ended up failing to qualify from league stage . on April 8 , 2015 , 0 : 54 GMT I do n't understand why the stats of Hyderabad Sunrisers and Deccan Chargers could n't be clubbed. Every reader would understand the stats even then. Now , by considering only the sunrisers history , the stats are skewed , especially in the no. of players used each season section. Sunrisers being a new team compared to the others will have a greater no. of new players than other teams . on April 7 , 2015 , 23 : 49 GMT the 2009 IPL winners were the deccan chargers who are no longer a franchise mus_tard on April 7 , 2015 , 22 : 53 GMT Sorry I also left out Emrit from my last comment , and that Daren Ganga was one of the best captains the region has ever seen. What I 'm trying to say is that a country of 1.3 million people producing players of such calibre and talent , to be the best team , is very remarkable . mus_tard on April 7 , 2015 , 22 : 45 GMT CSK arguably the best T20 team of all time. Arguably , but definitely not.. Take out their internationals and they are average. Trinidad and Tobago Red Force is the best T20 team of all time. Consistently won the Caribbean T20 , and reached the finals of the first Champions League , and crushing Chennai along the way. Pretty good for a country of only 1.3 million people. Imagine , nearly every man on that team has been called up for a T20 contract elsewhere already. Simmons , Barath , Lil Bravo , Dwayne Bravo , Pollard , Cooper , Narine , Rampaul. The only exceptions are Ramdin , The Ganga brothers , Perkins , the emerging Evin Lewis , and Stewart , then Pooran comes along. Imagine a Red Force team now ( not Red Steel ) . They would be world beaters. Unfortunately the CPL broke up that magnificent team . Asiwin on April 7 , 2015 , 19 : 38 GMT CHARLES RAY.. The players you mentioned were not part of Indian team ( apart from Dhoni and Balaji ( who was dropped by then ) when they started playing for CSK that is including Raina. Also we had Albie , Bravo , Baz , Smith , Nehra who played for other teams and did not succeed. Every team in IPL is like a WorldXI. Infact in the first IPL Kolkata was the strongest on paper and they did not even qualify for the semifinals.What CSK is doing is giving these indian players a stage to perform and once they develop are holding onto them instead of changing every year . vkumar_086 on April 7 , 2015 , 17 : 14 GMT CSK is my all time favourite club team...its star studded team with MSD , Baz , Duplessis , Raina , Bravo , Ashwin , Jadeja , Mohith...this time also CSK is one among semi finalists.. . Winning IPL is very difficult than winning WC...here BEST 8 teams are fighting for title & every match is important , top 2 teams of group stage will get another chance of rectifying their mistakes...BEST FORMAT unlike the very predictable WC format...hope ICC will follow this suit when it is arranging 10 teams WC in 2019...all the best to all IPL teams...game begins now on April 7 , 2015 , 16 : 42 GMT if you have the services of 70 % of the main team plays for India , you can win any where ! specially on Indian dust bowls ! Raina , Jadeja , Dhoni , Ashwin , Mohit , Nehra , in the present team , and Balaji , Badrinadh , Vijay , Pardiv , Karthik in the past , with international stars who bulldozed the order like Hayden , Hussey , Faf , Baz , Bravo , smith , Albie , Bollinger , Hilfenhause to share the spoils at any given time is always playing a world XI ! Yasin123Patel on April 7 , 2015 , 15 : 01 GMT Big Surprise is Rajasthan Royals ' winning ratio. Third best despite reaching final stages only 2 times , means they just failed in crucial matches like last season.but better record in final stage siddhartha87 on April 7 , 2015 , 12 : 49 GMT nice stats. Thanks a lot...... . ODI_BestFormOfCricket on April 7 , 2015 , 9 : 59 GMT CSK 's 9 out of 14 is far better than KKR 's 4 out of 5.
