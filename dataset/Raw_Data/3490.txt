( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 BANGALORE : Lahore Lions ' quest to qualify for the CLT20 semifinal came to a heart-breaking end after Perth Scorchers handed the Pakistan champions a three-wicket defeat in their last Group 'A ' league match at the M Chinnaswamy stadium in Bangalore on Tuesday . The outcome helped Chennai Super Kings join Kolkata Knight Riders in the semifinals from group 'A' . Replying to Lions ' modest 124 , Scorchers made heavy weather of their chase before Mitchell Marsh chipped in with a fighting 38-ball 63 to help his team post 130 and finish their tour of India on a high . Following their top order collapse , Scorchers rode on Marsh 's blistering innings which was laced with seven fours and three sixes to recover from a hopeless 35 for five en route to their second win of the tournament . Marsh joined hands with Brad Hogg ( 28 ) to forge an unfinished 68-run partnership from 41 balls to complete the rout with six balls to spare . After having struggled to post a modest 124 , largely on the back of Saad Nasim 's fighting 55-ball 69 , Lions needed to restrict Scorchers to 78 runs to better Chennai Super Kings net run rate and advance to the semifinals . Earlier , Perth captain Mitchell Marsh won the toss and elected to bowl first , but inclement weather arrived a mere three deliveries into the game with Lions already one down for two runs . Joel Paris ( 3/22 ) rattled the top order removing Nasir Jamshed in the third delivery of the innings and returned after a 45-minute rain-break to dismiss Umar Siddiq. Nasim 's blistering knock helped Lions recover from a humiliating 11 for four . Lions top order again came a cropper before Saad and Umar Akmal ( 26 ) steadied the innings. The fifth-wicket pair knitted 43 runs from 37 balls . In the other match of the night , Northern Knights scored 135/7 against Barbados Tridents while batting first after the match was reduced to 19-over-a-side due to rain interruptions . Brief scores : Lions 124/6 ( S Nasim 69 not out ; J Paris 3/22 ) lost to Scorchers 130/7 in 19 overs ( M Marsh 63 * ; M Hafeez 2/8 ) .
