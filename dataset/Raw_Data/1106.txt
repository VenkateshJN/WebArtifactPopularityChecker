" While his ODI ambitions may take longer to realise , Pujara 's immediate concern will be to revive his Test career . Having established himself as India 's number three , Pujara lost his place in the playing eleven for the final Test of the series against Australia in Sydney after a string of below-par performances . " In Test matches , my start was really good ; there were some phases where I accept that I did n't perform well but it happens , " he said . " If you see a cricketer 's career , nobody 's always successful. You have those up and down phases. If I look at all the series , I did well in South Africa.

" The 27-year-old Saurashtra batsman expects to be a different player when he returns from his stint with defending English county champions Yorkshire . " They are challenging conditions and as a batsman you have to accept the challenge. When you score runs in those conditions , you get a different confidence. So , technically you have to be correct. You have to be really focused ; confidence has to be up to the mark , " he said . " In all the aspects of the game you really have to be very careful when you play in English conditions. So , in this way couple of months in Yorkshire will help me , " Pujara said .
