World Cup 2015 : New Zealand rewrite record books against England The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Feb 20 , 2015 , 01.30PM IST Page 1 of 4 WELLINGTON : New Zealand 's eight-wicket World Cup thrashing of England in Wellington on Friday featured several landmark displays . Below are the statistical highlights from the Black Caps ' dominant display : Tim Southee ( 7-33 ) The New Zealand paceman 's return was the key cause of England 's collapse to 123 all out and gave the 26-year-old the third-best World Cup bowling figures of all-time behind the Australian duo of Glenn McGrath ( seven for 15 ) and Andy Bichel ( seven for 20 ) . His haul was also the best by a New Zealander in any one-day international , surpassing current Black Caps bowling coach Shane Bond 's six for 19 against India at Bulawayo in 2005 . Brendon McCullum ( 50 off 18 balls ) The New Zealand captain broke his own record for the quickest World Cup fifty with a half-century in two fewer deliveries than he 'd managed during the 2007 edition against minnows Canada in St Lucia . It was the joint third-quickest ODI fifty of all time behind South Africa 's AB de Villiers ( 16 balls ) and Sri Lanka 's Sanath Jayasuriya ( 17 balls ) . Steven Finn ( none for 49 in two overs ) The England quick recorded the most expensive figures , in terms of runs per over , for a bowler sending down at least two overs in all ODI cricket . The brief spell gave Finn an average of 24.5 runs per over conceded compared to 21.3 set by the West Indies paceman Ravi Rampaul in a three-over spell of none for 64 against New Zealand in Queenstown last year . Rampaul did not make the West Indies ' World Cup squad . Victory achieved in 12.2 overs of second innings By wrapping up their win in 12.2 overs , New Zealand equalled the record for the fewest number of overs to reach a one-day international target against England originally set when Australia made 118 without loss against their arch-rivals in Sydney in 2003 . It was the equal second-fastest successful chase of a 100-plus target in ODIs. The quickest was in 2003 when South Africa achieved a target of 109 against Bangladesh in 12 overs . 226 balls remaining when New Zealand won This equalled England 's heaviest in terms of balls remaining , with Australia also having 226 balls to spare when they beat England in Sydney in 2003 . 123 runs scored by England This was England 's lowest score in World Cups after electing to bat and their third-lowest overall in World Cups .
