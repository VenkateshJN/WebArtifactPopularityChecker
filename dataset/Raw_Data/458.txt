Â© AFP Melbourne : Virat Kohli says he enjoys the on-field banter with Australia but he let his bat do the talking on Sunday with a Test-best 169 to help India fight back in the third Test. ( Day 3 report | Scorecard | Highlights ) Kohli claimed his third century of the series and his fifth against Australia as he joined Ajinkya Rahane ( 147 ) in a 262-run fourth-wicket stand.

Laxman.

" I like playing against Australia because it 's very hard for them to stay calm , " he said . " I do n't mind. I will give it on the field. It really excites me and brings the best out in me . " They do n't seem to be learning the lesson. " Kohli , who scored twin centuries in the first Adelaide Test and has amassed 445 runs at 89 in the series to date , had a running battle with Australia 's main strike bowler Mitchell Johnson . At one stage he even blew kisses at Johnson when he hit him back over his head for four . " It was going on throughout the day , " Kohli said . " They were calling me a spoilt brat and I said 'Maybe that 's the way I am -- I know you guys hate me and I like that' . " So I do n't mind having a chat on the field and it worked in my favour , I guess. " At one time Johnson hurled the ball at Kohli , hitting him on the back . Johnson quickly apologised but the mood soured , with the umpires intervening to ease tensions between the pair . " I was really annoyed with him hitting me with the ball and I told him 'That 's not on : try to hit the stumps next time , not my body ' , " he said . Kohli said he was backing himself against Johnson , Ryan Harris and Australia 's other bowlers in the four-Test series . " His ( Johnson 's ) job is bowl and get wickets and he was going at 4.7 runs an over today , " he said . " He did n't get a wicket throughout the day ( until the last over ) and I knew -- I back myself that I can take him on , even if I keep talking to him . " That 's important , you ca n't back off after saying a few words and then not show it with your skill . " So I decided when he comes onto bowl , I 'm going to back myself and take him on as well. I do n't mind giving a word back and neither does he. So it kept going on. " It was a bruising day for Johnson , who finished with one for 133. The last time he had been punished as severely was 0-104 against England at the Gabba in 2010 .
