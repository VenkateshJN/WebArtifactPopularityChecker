As he informed the necessary officials without any delay , no action will be taken against the approached player . During IPL 2013 , three players from Rajasthan Royals - S Sreesanth , Ankeet Chavan and Ajit Chandila - were found guilty of spot-fixing. Sreesanth and Chavan were handed life bans by the BCCI 's disciplinary committee . The spot-fixing scandal of 2013 led to the expulsion of top officials of Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals. This included the son-in-law ( Gurunath Meiyappan ) of former Board president and ICC chairman N. Srinivasan. The case is still being adjudicated by the Supreme Court , with a special panel headed by the former Chief Justice of India investigating the matter .
