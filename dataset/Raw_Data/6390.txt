vbthegr8 on February 23 , 2015 , 11 : 44 GMT Would make it to Pakistan team instead of any of haris sohail . wapuser on February 21 , 2015 , 13 : 09 GMT Ha ha you compare sakib with N McCullum....ridiculous.. .your NZ team suffered in bd at last two ODI series against Bangladesh..how u forgot sakib & be team performance....& of course vettori is great all rounder & Corey Anderson is a big name...do n't blame good rather appreciate it. . wapuser on February 21 , 2015 , 12 : 53 GMT Ha ha....stevies you compare sakib with N McCallum ...ridiculous.... your NZ team got two consecutive white wash at ODI in bd against Bangladesh...you saw the performance of bd team & sakib vs NZ...in NZ condition spinners may not help full but batsman have important role....& of course vettori is a brilliant all rounder...also Corey Anderson a big name....do not blame good which arise from lower rather learn to appreciate it.. . wapuser on February 21 , 2015 , 12 : 30 GMT I think Shakib is an automatic choice for everyy team . StevieS on February 21 , 2015 , 11 : 26 GMT He would n't make NZ ODI team as Vettori is a better ODI bowler and our alrounders are more explosive batters. He would however be in the squad instead of N McCullum. Needing two spinners in NZ conditions is a rarity. Test matches , yes he would make the team . wapuser on February 21 , 2015 , 9 : 10 GMT I wo n't say he is the best but certainly he is one of the best all rounder currently playing in this prestigious event , then i look in to Bangladesh team n i feel , talent like shakib is getting waste that is why i think he should have been in some different sude.but since thats not gon na happen anyway so just leave it..but i must say he would be the best thing that Bangladesh have ever produced.. . Saz ID | 10152610102080079 on February 21 , 2015 , 8 : 45 GMT @ STRATOCASTER Shakib 's bating avg. with Pak is 41 , India 36 , west indies 32 , sri lanka 30 wapuser on February 21 , 2015 , 8 : 39 GMT He got five wickets agaisnt all teams he played. He did not played against australia. And check his career in franchise based T20 , if you keep updates of cricket and jealous about some one 's achievement than you must have some words of appreciation for him . wapuser on February 21 , 2015 , 7 : 39 GMT He is of the best in the world at this time Stratocaster on February 21 , 2015 , 7 : 20 GMT @ Zubair Mahmud Where are his stats vs better nations ? India ? Saffas ? Australia ? England ? Sri Lanka ? Pakistan ? New Zealand ? And any worthwhile stat outside Bangladesh ? Let me tell you , they 're far and few in between . Popular Videos
