Srinivasan can prop up Yadav or Patel : Source The author has posted comments on this article Indranil Basu , TNN | Jan 28 , 2015 , 09.36AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 NEW DELHI : With his chances of contesting for the post of president in the BCCI elections looking bleak , N Srinivasan is likely to prop up either of his close aides , Shiv Lal Yadav or Sanjay Patel , as his candidate for the top BCCI post in the board 's AGM , to be held soon . Yadav is now the interim president of the board while Patel is the board 's secretary. " These names have been doing the rounds in case Srinivasan ca n't contest the BCCI elections , " a source close to the development told TOI . The entrenched boss of the board , who is currently representing BCCI in ICC 's meeting in Dubai , was keen on fighting the polls before he left for Dubai. But with murmurs of " how can he contest when the Supreme Court has clearly barred him from doing so ? " gaining voice within the board , the Srinivasan camp is gradually coming to terms with reality . Sources said BCCI vice-president and Union finance minister Arun Jaitley 's opinion would be considered before the names of candidates for the elections are shortlisted. Jaitley is tipped to meet Srinivasan soon after the latter 's return from Dubai . In 2013 , when Srinivasan stepped aside , it was Jaitley who suggested Jagmohan Dalmiya 's name for the post of the interim president of BCCI. Meanwhile , it was learnt that the auction for IPL 8 will be held on February 16 and workshop will be held on the next day .
