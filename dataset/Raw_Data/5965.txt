Graphs Vinay goes up to the stage to receive the Ranji Trophy. The entire team get across for a photo-session with the gleaming trophy. Plenty of happiness in the Karnataka camp. They have now won 5 major domestic titles in a row. Can they add another one ? Karnataka take on Rest of India in the Irani Trophy match , beginning on 17th March , at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium , Bengaluru. Do join us for all the action. For now , cheers and bye. . Vinay : It 's a big moment - winning the trophy. I am thankful to the entire team. I am very happy with my own performance. 5 wickets and a century - I was told I equalled Vijay Hazare Sir 's achievement. The wicket in Mumbai is very sportive , there 's some help for everyone. The Ranji trophy is very important and to be winning twice in succession is exceptional. I think we can dominate for a long time in future if we play in this manner. We are not thinking too far ahead , we need to play well in the Irani trophy which is coming up in the near future . The Karnataka players are being called for individual mementoes , small replicas of the original Ranji silverware Nair : Credit should go to the whole team , especially , the bowlers. They bowled them out for 134. The partnership with Rahul was the game changer. It was a good batting surface , a little extra bounce , I settled as the innings went on. Not running the fast singles meant we were n't tired. That helped us during the partnership , it was n't a great season until the final , but hopefully I will get better with time Karun Nair is the MoM for his stupendous 328 Mukund : The first day , we could have batted well in the first innings , but it 's history now. We got four early wickets , but the partnership took the game away from us. It 's been a great journey for us , we are disappointed at losing , but it 's a lesson for us. We came up against a good team , but competed well. There were a few positives and we will look to take those to the next season . It 's time for the presentations now. First up is Abhinav Mukund , Tamil Nadu 's capatin. . Bhavane : I am really happy , this was my debut season and the team management never made me feel as one. Rahul is my batting idol , Karun is a classy batsman and not to forget Vinay - he 's an outstanding captain . Sharath : I missed a lot of action this year with the shoulder injury , but it 's a nice feeling. I want to get better with time . Arvind : Happy with my comeback , it 's been a fantastic season , thankful to my captain , coach and the administration , they backed me all along. My favourite wicket in the match was the dismissal of Prasanna . Manish : Happy with the way we played this season. I managed to get a stump as well , as a souvenier . Shreyas Gopal : I am trying to be an all-rounder , if I get some runs , that will help my team. I want to take more wickets and get better in the future. I want to do well in the future and improve myself . Karun : It feels nice. In terms of numbers , I think I made it up in the finals. Not disappointed with not been able to score 400 , I carried on for as long as I could . Rahul : We will enjoy this moment , not everytime a team wins 5 trophies on a trot. We will enjoy tonight , take a couple of days and get ready for the Irani trophy The boys deserve this , it 's a reward for some hard work. We want to continue with this dominance for a few more years . Uthappa : Winning two Ranji trophies is special. We wil definitely enjoy this moment , but the actual celebrations will start after the Irani trophy . Mithun : Very very happy , personally , it was a good season for me. And bowling with Vinay was special as well , looking forward to better performances in the future . Vinay Kumar : Very happy , it 's a great moment , a special bunch of boys , very proud of them , also thankful to the coaches , managers and the administration for backing us all the way. It 's been an excellent team-effort. I am not going to forget this effort , getting 5-wickets and a hundred , I am the first captain to achieve this feat. Very very happy .

After a topsy-turvy Day 1 of the Ranji Trophy final , it 's pretty even-stevens.
