World Cup 2015 : Shami is match-fit , Bhuvneshwar has heavy strapping on ankles The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Mar 3 , 2015 , 07.53PM IST Shami was rested in the UAE match as a precautionary measure. ( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 PERTH : India speedster Mohammed Shami has apparently recovered from his knee injury and is available for selection in team 's next group league match against West Indies on March 6 . Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 Shami was rested in the UAE match as a precautionary measure but the Bengal pacer took part in the training activity at the Murdoch University Oval Sports Complex ground on Tuesday . He took part in fielding drills and also bowled a bit. In case Shami is picked in the playing XI , Bhuvneshwar Kumar might again be sidelined after having made a comeback against the minnows in the last game , where he got a wicket and bowled at a decent early 130 kmph pace . " Shami is fit and available for selection , " team 's media manager RN Baba said . While there is no update on Bhuvneshwar Kumar , the pacer on Tuesday was seen having his ankle heavily strapped as he walked barefoot into the dressing room . It may be a case of the ankle being taped to protect it from aggravating after having bowled full tilt in the last game. The WACA is a hard ground and a pace bowler 's ankle takes more pounding on delivery landing compared to some of the other grounds . So it 's not clear that whether Bhuvneshwar has again done some damage to his ankles or not .
