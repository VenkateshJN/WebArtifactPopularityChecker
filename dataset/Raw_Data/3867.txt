Chasing a victory target of 403 , Rest of India were bowled out for 156 after opening bowler Abhimanyu Mithun ripped through the top order. The right-armer picked up three wickets in his first two overs to break the back of the visitors ' innings . Although skipper Manoj Tiwary ( 24 ) and opener Jiwanjot Singh ( 38 ) added 55 runs for the fourth wicket , once the partnership was broken it was just a matter of time before Karnataka completed the rout . Jiwanjot uppishly cut H.S. Sharath to Abhishek Reddy who caught on the second attempt while Tiwary departed soon after , playing distantly to seamer Sreenath Arvind. He dragged the ball on to his stumps . Thereafter , the Rest of India resistance was rather tepid with only Kedar Jadhav ( 56 , 48b , 6x4 , 3x6 ) showing some spark of aggression before he perished , sweeping leg-spinner Shreyas Gopal to Reddy. Gopal picked up four wickets to complete a massive win for Karnataka . Earlier , Karnataka , resuming at 341 for 6 piled on the misery for Rest of India , setting a target of 403. Manish Pandey 's brilliant unbeaten 123 ( 164b. 12x4 , 3x6 ) anchored the innings as he notched his first century of the season . There was little respite for Rest of India bowlers among whom seamer Shardul Thakur , among the most successful bowlers this season , picked up all the four remaining wickets to come away with a five for 86 haul . Brief scores : Karnataka 244 and 422 all out in 110.3 overs ( Ravikumar Samarth 81 , Abhishek Reddy 31 , Karun Nair 80 , Manish Pandey 123 not out , Vinay Kumar 38 ; Varun Aaron 2 for 131 , Pragyan Ojha 2 for 93 , Shardul Thakur 5 for 86 ) beat Rest of India 264 and 156 all out in 43.3 overs ( Jiwanjot Singh 38 , Kedar Jadhav 56 ; Abhimanyu Mithun 3 for 40 , Shreyas Gopal 4 for 39 ) .
