World Cup 2015 : We have to brush off India loss , says Amla The author has posted comments on this article IANS | Feb 25 , 2015 , 06.12PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 BRISBANE : South Africa 's opening batsman Hashim Amla Wednesday urged his teammates to " brush off " and not be " dramatic " about their dismal loss against India Sunday and to look forward to their upcoming games in the World Cup . " We did n't manage to string enough big partnerships closely together and we lost wickets at key times. Things like that happen. We just want to brush it off , take the knock on our chin , and get our heads up for the next game , " Amla was quoted as saying by espncricinfo . " Everybody in the team has played enough to know that you do win and lose games. There can only be one winner and one loser. So , let 's not get too dramatic about it , " he said . The 31-year-old , who has been in quite impressive form of late scoring two hundreds and three fifties in his last nine innings , added he has been striking the ball well but it is not everyday that a batsman can perform to his potential . " I 'd love to score runs every game but I do n't think it 's possible. It 's been a slow start and hopefully it gets better. I 'm feeling good. Everybody goes through a few games in which they do n't score runs , " he said . South Africa 's 130-run loss at the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ) Sunday was their worst in a World Cup , while batting second , but it is not likely to have a significant impact on whether they qualify for the knockout stages . " You want to finish as high as possible. But if you qualify for the quarterfinal , so be it. If you want to win a World Cup you 're going to need to play the best teams to win it. There 's no trying to avoid anybody , " concluded Amla . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
