Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 The islanders were bowled out for a paltry total of 133 , which South Africa chased down in just 18 overs with nine wickets to spare to enter the semifinals . " This is easily the worst performance that we 've done in the World Cup and it happened to be in the quarter-finals. It 's disappointing not to make it a memorable one for Mahela and Sanga. But let me take this opportunity on behalf of the country and the team to thank them for their services , " Mathews said at the post-match presentation ceremony at the Sydney Cricket Ground ( SCG ) here . " They have rendered their services for more than 16-17 years and it 's invaluable service. So , we really salute them and thank them. The best thing would have been to go to the final and win it for them , but unfortunately we could n't do it and we 'll find a way to try and make them smile. " The 27-year-old blamed nerves for such a dismal performance in the business-end of the tournament . " There were no demons on the track , we could have batted well. We could have at least got to 250 and given our bowlers a chance , but unfortunately we did n't bat well. Maybe the nerves , we just did n't go for the shots , " he added .
