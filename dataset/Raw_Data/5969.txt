with the bat as Dhawan was dismissed for a duck. Che Pujara looked in decent touch before he got out to Lalor. Kohli and Vijay then combined well to perk up the Indian innings. The former had a slice of luck when he was dropped in the slip cordon. Can the duo help the Indians put up a healthy total on board and multiply their confidence ahead of the bigger Tests ahead ? Do join us back tomorrow to find out.

The Indians made early inroads , reducing Cricket Australia Invitational XI to 34/3. However , Jordan Silk dug in and later unfurled some lovely strokes to help his recover to 101/3. Keath is also looking good at the other end. Ishant is leading the Indians with Kohli out of action today. Kohli though is expected to bat tomorrow. Early on , before the start of the match , the Indians put their bats out in remembrance of Phil Hughes , who was laid to rest in Macksville yesterday . 24.6 Aaron to Jordan Silk , no run 24.5 Aaron to Jordan Silk , no run 24.4 Aaron to Jordan Silk , no run 24.3 Aaron to Jordan Silk , no run 24.2 Aaron to Keath , 1 run , to cover 24.1 Aaron to Keath , no run 23.6 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , no run 23.5 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , FOUR , to long on 23.4 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , no run 23.3 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , no run 23.2 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , no run 23.1 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , no run 22.6 Aaron to Keath , no run 22.5 Aaron to Jordan Silk , 1 run , to cover point 22.4 Aaron to Jordan Silk , no run 22.3 Aaron to Jordan Silk , no run 22.2 Aaron to Jordan Silk , FOUR , to third man 22.1 Aaron to Jordan Silk , no run Varun Aaron [ 4.0-0-17-1 ] is back into the attack 21.6 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , 1 run , to mid off 21.5 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , no run 21.4 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , SIX , to long on 21.3 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , no run 21.2 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , no run 21.1 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , FOUR , to long off 20.6 Ishant to Keath , no run 20.5 Ishant to Keath , no run 20.4 Ishant to Keath , no run 20.3 Ishant to Keath , no run 20.2 Ishant to Keath , no run 20.1 Ishant to Keath , no run 19.6 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , no run 19.5 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , 2 runs , to fine leg 19.4 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , FOUR , to long on 19.3 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , no run 19.2 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , no run 19.1 Karn Sharma to Jordan Silk , no run Karn Sharma , right-arm leg break , comes into the attack 18.6 Ishant to Keath , no run 18.5 Ishant to Keath , no run 18.4 Ishant to Keath , no run 18.3 Ishant to Keath , no run 18.2 Ishant to Jordan Silk , 1 run , to mid on 18.1 Ishant to Jordan Silk , no run 17.6 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , 1 run , to backward square leg 17.5 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 17.4 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 17.3 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 17.2 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 17.1 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 16.6 Ishant to Keath , no run 16.5 Ishant to Keath , no run 16.4 Ishant to Keath , no run 16.3 Ishant to Keath , no run 16.2 Ishant to Keath , no run 16.1 Ishant to Keath , no run 15.6 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 15.5 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 15.4 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 15.3 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 15.2 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 15.1 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , FOUR , to mid wicket 14.6 Ishant to Keath , no run 14.5 Ishant to Keath , no run 14.4 Ishant to Keath , no run 14.3 Ishant to Jordan Silk , 1 run , to point 14.2 Ishant to Jordan Silk , FOUR , to fine leg 14.1 Ishant to Jordan Silk , no run 13.6 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , 1 run , to square leg 13.5 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 13.4 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 13.3 U Yadav to Keath , 3 runs , to backward square leg 13.2 U Yadav to Keath , no run 13.1 U Yadav to Keath , no run 12.6 Ishant to Keath , leg byes , 1 run 12.5 Ishant to Keath , no run 12.4 Ishant to Jordan Silk , 1 run , to cover 12.3 Ishant to Jordan Silk , no run 12.2 Ishant to Jordan Silk , no run 12.1 Ishant to Jordan Silk , 2 runs , to backward square leg 12.1 Ishant to Jordan Silk , no ball Ishant Sharma , right-arm fast , comes into the attack 11.6 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , 3 runs , to third man 11.5 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 11.4 U Yadav to Keath , 1 run , to cover 11.3 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , 1 run , to mid on 11.2 U Yadav to Keath , 1 run , to fine leg 11.1 U Yadav to Keath , FOUR , to third man 10.6 Shami to Jordan Silk , no run 10.5 Shami to Jordan Silk , no run 10.4 Shami to Jordan Silk , no run 10.3 Shami to Jordan Silk , 2 runs , to mid wicket 10.2 Shami to Jordan Silk , no run 10.1 Shami to Keath , 1 run , to cover 10.1 Shami to Keath , no ball 9.6 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 9.5 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 9.4 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 9.3 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 9.2 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run 9.1 U Yadav to Jordan Silk , no run Umesh Yadav , right-arm fast medium , comes into the attack 8.6 Shami to Keath , no run 8.5 Shami to Keath , no run 8.4 Shami to Keath , no run 8.3 Shami to Jordan Silk , 1 run , to mid on 8.2 Shami to Jordan Silk , no run 8.1 Shami to Keath , 1 run , to cover 7.6 Aaron to Jordan Silk , no run 7.5 Aaron to Jordan Silk , no run 7.4 Aaron to Jordan Silk , no run 7.3 Aaron to Jordan Silk , FOUR , to deep mid wicket 7.2 Aaron to Jordan Silk , no run 7.1 Aaron to Jordan Silk , no run 6.6 Shami to Keath , no run Alex Keath , right handed bat , comes to the crease 6.5 Shami to Short , out Caught by W Saha ! !
