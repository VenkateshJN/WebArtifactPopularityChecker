Modi demands CBI inquiry into IPL scandal The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Apr 20 , 2014 , 09.28PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 NEW DELHI : Former IPL commissioner Lalit Modi today opposed the three-member committee suggested by the BCCI to the Supreme Court to probe the IPL spot-fixing and betting scandal and demanded an inquiry by the CBI . " There should be no compromise on new panel. Current proposed panel has Srini cronies on it. Supreme Court should allow Cbi 2 only do enquiry , " Modi said in a series of tweets . Modi also objected to the inclusion of former India all-rounder in the three-member panel. The other two members are former Calcutta High Court Chief Justice JN Patel and ex-CBI director RK Raghavan . " Ravi Shastri completely bias and on bcci pay roll. Cbi must do enquiry. It will end all bias , " said Modi . He said he was surprised that Justice Mukul Mudgal 's name was not there in the panel . " All names proposed by Srini are names that all should be ignored. Justice Mudgal investigated the first - surprised his name not there . " The mere fact that there is so much friction on who to appoint as enquiry commission by Srini Camp shows clearly that they have something to hide . " Secondly it shows they have vested interest in which way the enquiry goes. Third it shows this is how they have always operated , " Modi tweeted .
