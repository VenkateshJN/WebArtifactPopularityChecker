Â© AP London : England must forget about former captain Alastair Cook as they begin preparations for the World Cup , fast bowler James Anderson said in a British newspaper interview published on Monday . Test skipper Cook lost his one-day role in December following a run of five straight defeats , with Eoin Morgan being handed the responsibility of leading the team at the World Cup in Australia , which starts on February 14 . Anderson admitted he was " gutted " about Cook 's dismissal , but said that England can not afford to waste time worrying about the past as the tournament looms into view . " I 'm gutted for my mate. However , as brutal or heartless as it may sound , I ca n't go to Australia worrying about how Cooky is feeling or wishing he was with us , " Anderson told The Sun . " My only consideration is to focus on helping the team in the Tri-series with Australia and India and then the World Cup that follows. " He added : " Cooky has a couple of months now to try and get over the disappointment. I 'm sure it will be hard watching the guys playing in the World Cup on TV , but he must look forward to the Test matches in 2015.
