( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 MOHALI : In an unusual but successful move , skipper Harbhajan Singh promoted himself to No. 3 position and smashed a 50-ball 78 , thus playing a pivotal role in Punjab 's nine-run win over Services in a North Zone leg match of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy on Friday . While Harbhajan was the top scorer , Himanshu Chawla also hit a quickfire 50 off 34 balls as they enabled Punjab reach a competitive total of 154 for six in their allotted 20 overs . The hosts then restricted Services to 145 for nine , thanks to leg-spinner Rahul Sharma 's impressive bowling figures of 4-0-21-4 and some great work on the field that resulted in three run-outs . Electing to bat , Punjab lost openers Manan Vohra ( 5 ) and Mandeep Singh ( 0 ) and Gurkeerat Singh ( 5 ) cheaply to be reeling at 35 for three in 6.6 overs , before Harbhajan and Himanshu steadied the boat . The duo put on a solid 99-run stand for the fourth wicket to bail the team out and steer it towards a respectable total. Harbhajan 's impressive knock included nine fours and four sixes , while Himanshu 's innings had five boundaries and a maximum . In reply , Services had a poor start as they lost as many as four wickets for just 34 runs on the board . It was captain Yashpal Singh ( 24 ) and Soumya Swain ( 46 ) who consolidated the position and stitched 67 runs together for the fifth wicket to keep Services ' hopes alive . But just when things were starting to look promising for Services , Rahul Sharma struck to see off Yashpal. And even though Swain continued to slog in the middle , three successive batsmen -- Avishek Sinha ( 10 ) , Suraj Yadav ( 10 ) and Shadab Nazar ( 10 ) -- were all run out . In the end , Services fell short . Brief scores : Punjab : 154 for six ( Harbhajan Singh 78 , Himanshu Chawla 50 ; Arnav Kush 2/37 ) . Services : 145 for nine ( Soumya Swain 46 , Yashpal Singh 24 ; Rahul Sharma 4/21 ) . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
