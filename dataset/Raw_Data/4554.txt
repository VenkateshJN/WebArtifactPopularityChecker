Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 " It was a very good performance ( by the bowlers ) , " he said , emphasising how the track had eased out in the second half to favour batsmen. It always looked like a good batting track but early on there was variable bounce. The ball was coming a little slower on to the bat at times. In the second half , it came faster and that made batting comparatively easier , " he said . Umesh Yadav 's four-wicket haul , Mohammed Shami and Ravindra Jadeja 's two each and Mohit Sharma 's sole scalp complimented Rohit Sharma 's century to give India a 109-run win . But Dhoni did not forget to mention R Ashwin 's contribution - a very economical 30 runs in 10 overs - that kept the opposition in check . " The most difficult thing to do when you 're doing well is to keep things simple , " the skipper added , giving credit to the manner in which the batsmen went about their job cautiously and the bowlers maintained discipline . On the batting front , he spoke of how the " Rohit-Raina partnership " was crucial. " Another wicket and we might have finished for a lesser total. Raina , who 's been the more aggressive one , got going and Rohit took over. And if Rohit bats long enough , he can really get going , " Dhoni noted . MORTAZA SUSPENDED FOR ONE ODI The ICC on Thursday suspended Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza for one ODI and fined him 40 per cent of his match fee due to slow overrate during their loss to India in the quarterfinals .
