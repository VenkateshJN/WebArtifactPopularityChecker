( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 HYDERABAD : The CLT20 is another chance for MS Dhoni to add one more feather to the Chennai Super Kings cap . Excerpts from an interaction.. . On CSK 's prospects : We are a very good side. It depends on how well we play and adapt. The good thing is that we have ( Dwayne ) Bravo back. We had missed him during the IPL. He got injured and that really affected the strength and combination of the side. Most of the players have been playing international cricket and have scored runs , like Faf Du Plessis or Suresh Raina . On the opener against KKR : They are a very good team. We have played each other quite a few times. Most of the core group has remained the same in both teams. They are a good side and they have their own strengths. We rely on different stuff. Overall , most of the teams in the CLT20 are excellent sides . On other IPL teams posing a stiffer challenge for CSK : There are quite a few winners from the IPL sides. They know the conditions well. The Indian teams have a very good chance but this format is sort of a lottery where you have to be at your best on a particular day. An individual can win the game . On the switch to T20 after Tests and ODIs : After a Test series , you play ODIs and that has its own demands. Here , you do n't have too much time on your hands as you gather 10 days before the start. You do n't get much time to be with the team. This is like a refresher course .
