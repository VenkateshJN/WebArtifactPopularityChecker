With Tamil Nadu facing Mumbai next , the side is set to be bolstered by the return of M Vijay.

The slide for UP in the second innings began as early as in the third over when medium-pacer Vijay Shankar had opener Akash Verma ( 2 ) nick one to keeper U Sushil. With the spinners coming into play , UP soon found themselves in a hole , placed at 62-6 in the 30th over. Tight bowling backed by purposeful fielding meant Tamil Nadu gave no easy runs.

" As the ball got a little older , we began to vary our pace which got us more purchase on this pitch , " noted Malolan. While Suresh accounted for Tanmay Srivastava ( 7 , 1x4 ) , Himanshu Asnora ( 18 , 2x4 ) , Arish Alam ( 0 ) and Eklavya Dwivedi ( 20 , 1x4 , 1x6 ) , Malolan ran through the UP lower-order.
