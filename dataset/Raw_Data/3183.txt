World Cup 2015 : Zimbabwe target West Indies after UAE win The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Feb 19 , 2015 , 11.47AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 NELSON ( New Zealand ) : Zimbabwe captain Elton Chigumbura targeted victory over the slumping West Indies on Thursday after a four-wicket triumph against the United Arab Emirates breathed new life into their World Cup campaign . After losing their opener to South Africa , Zimbabwe allowed the UAE to carve out the Middle East nation 's highest one-day international score of 285 before claiming victory with 12 balls to spare at Nelson 's Saxton Oval . " We need to take this momentum into the game against the West Indies , " said Chigumbura , whose side face the men from the Caribbean in Canberra on Monday . " Hopefully we can polish up our fielding and have a good game in all departments. " Chigumbura also praised the depth of his batting line-up , which saw Sean Williams making an undefeated 76 batting at five and Craig Ervine , at seven , hitting 42 at almost a run-a-ball . " I thought the guys played well with the bat. The good thing about our team is we have eight batters so there was no pressure , " the skipper said. " Getting over the line was the most important thing to do and we did it. " UAE captain Mohammad Tauqir admitted that despite his side making a ODI best total on their return to the World Cup after an absence of almost two decades , they did n't have quite enough runs on the board . " We played some good cricket but we were expecting a different result. In the previous game on this wicket we saw that 300 was not enough ( when West Indies lost to Ireland ) , " said the 43-year-old . " We know our limitations and we scored 285. But they batted well , struck up some good partnerships and they won the game. " Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
