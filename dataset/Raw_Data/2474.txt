( PTI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 HYDERABAD : The much-awaited clash between Kolkata Knight Riders and Lahore Lions turned into a tame affair as the two-time IPL champions cantered to a four-wicket win in their second Group B match of the CLT20 tournament on Sunday . KKR , who are on a roll , extended their winning streak to 11 matches the longest by an IPL team. Chasing 152 , the 'home ' team started off cautiously but once the openers got their bearing there was no stopping them. The Lions ' bowling lacked bite and even their fielding was not up to the mark . Skipper Gautam Gambhir made a welcome return to form as he stroked his way to a 47-ball 60 with eight hits to the fence as the Knight Riders reached 153 for six to take full points from the game and top the table . The southpaw strung a 100-run stand for the opening wicket with Robin Uthappa off 75 balls to put his side on path of victory. Uthappa , who is returning from an injury , took time to settle down but once he got his eyes in , he took on the Lions. Uthappa struck four fours and two sixes in his 34-ball 46 . Though KKR needlessly lost a couple of wickets , they had enough firepower in their ranks to settle the issue without much ado . Earlier , the Lions were caught in a spin trap as 'mystery man ' Sunil Narine tricked the Pakistani side into submission . Put into bat , the Lions failed to confront the challenge posed by Narine. Narine finished with figures of three for nine off four overs . Wicketkeeper Umar Akmal spared the Lions ' blushes with a 23-ball 40 .
