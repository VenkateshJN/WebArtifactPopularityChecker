Numbers games : Champs with plenty to defend The author has posted comments on this article Ajit Bezbaruah , TNN | Feb 2 , 2015 , 12.07PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 As defending champions , expectations from Team India are sky high. And despite a poor Test series and an equally disastrous tri-series , no one is writing them off . Because , this team has the potential to defend the cup. But for that to happen India will need to put few things in order. Virat Kohli , Ajinkya Rahane , Suresh Raina , Ambati Rayudu and skipper MS Dhoni himself look pretty solid but they need someone at the top who can get the team off to a flyer . The bowling all-rounder , who has played such a crucial role in India 's previous World Cup victories-Mohinder Amarnath in 1983 and Yuvraj Singh in 2011--needs to be identified. R Ashwin looks to be the ideal man for this position and if Binny does n't open , he too can perhaps be tried . The frontline bowlers need to keep it straight , simple and tight , without experimenting too much in the early overs so that the match is not out of India 's grasp in the first 10 overs itself . Ishant Sharma , Bhuvaneshwar Kumar and Mohammad Shami can do that but they have been way off the mark. Batsman like AB de Villiers , David Warner , Chris Gayle or Brendon McCullum will score runs from anything one throws at them , it is a matter of how less one can make them score . Spinners Ravindra Jadeja or Axar Patel can be pretty miserly and mean. With big outfields and bouncy tracks , they can be pretty handy. If only they both can contribute with the bat as well , it will be an icing on the cake . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
