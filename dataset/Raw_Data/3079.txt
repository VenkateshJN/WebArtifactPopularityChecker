( Reuters Photo ) Page 1 of 4 WELLINGTON : Top-order batsman Joe Root 's strokeful 121 helped England post a respectable 309 for six against Sri Lanka in a Pool A ODI match of the cricket World Cup on Sunday . Scorecard Electing to bat at the Westpac Stadium , England were in a bit of trouble at 161 for four before a 98-run partnership between Root , whose 108-ball stay was laced with 14 fours and 2 sixes , and James Taylor put the innings back on course to a big total . Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 The defiant stand , which is a record 5th wicket partnership for England in World Cup matches , came in just 11 overs as the Sri Lankan bowlers had little answer to brisk run-scoring . In the end though it was an unbeaten 19-ball 39 from Jos Buttler that really pushed the England total beyond the 300 plus mark . The Eoin Morgan-led side though started off well with Moeen Ali ( 15 ) and Ian Bell ( 49 ) sticking it out in the first 9 overs . Fielding was a big let down by the islanders , as Bell was dropped in the fourth over twice and later Root was also given a life when he was in single digits . Sri Lanka captain and medium-pacer Angelo Mathews ( 1-43 ) drew first flood after picking up Ali and off-spinner Tilakaratne Dilshan ( 1-29 ) soon scalped Gary Ballance ( 6 ) with a caught and bowled effort . Bell hung around for a while only to see new-ball bowler Suranga Lakmal ( 1-71 ) deny the opener his fifty. Morgan ( 49 ) also stuck around for sometime but Thisara Perera ( 1-55 ) got his prized wicket an over before the start of the powerplays in the 35th over . After that it was a Root-Taylor show as the duo combined the right dose of caution and aggression to not only see England out of trouble but also took the attack to the opposition . Root , who struck his 4th ODI ton in 52 matches , was severe on Perera in the 45th over as he smashed a six and three fours after Taylor 's opening six to fetch 25 runs from six balls . Taylor got out to Lasith Malinga ( 1-63 ) after his 26-ball cameo and Root was trapped LBW off left-arm spinner Rangana Herath ( 1-35 ) but only after the duo had done sufficient damage . The final five overs gave England 52 runs and the last over 22 as Buttler smashed 6 fours and a six to finish off with a flourish .
