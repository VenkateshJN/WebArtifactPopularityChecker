World Cup 2015 : Short-ball tactics could backfire on India , says Smith The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Mar 24 , 2015 , 10.53PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 SYDNEY : Steve Smith feels peppering the Australian batsman with the too many short balls could backfire on India when the two teams meet in the World Cup semifinal on Thursday . Pakistan pacer Wahab Riaz had troubled the Australians , especially Michael Clarke and Shane Watson , in the quarterfinal but he ended up being the long ranger for his team as the co-hosts eventually won the game comfortably .

" A couple of guys have got out to the short ball and that is just part and parcel of the game - you have got to get out some way , " Smith was quoted as saying by Sydney Morning Herald . " For us , we are expecting them to come out and potentially bowl a little bit too short for this wicket. If they try and jam them on this wicket it might suit us with these quick boundaries. It could play into our hands , " he said . Smith said he is also feeling good about his batting . " I did n't feel out of form. I just felt like I was out of sync a little bit with a few of my movements. " " But that 's back , my swing 's back where I want it to be , so hopefully I can continue crunching India around the park , " he added .
