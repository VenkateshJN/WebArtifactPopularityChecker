I 've been reading you both for ages but never heard you speak. More please . SRAM20 on February 23 , 2015 , 1 : 30 GMT Agree with a lot of commenters here. MS Dhoni has so far been the best captain in this World Cup. McCullum has a gun of a bowling attack comprising of Southee , Milne , Boult , Anderson , etc. and they have played all their games at home. They have also played against two minnows ( Scotland and England ; well England displayed minnow level qualities in their rout against NZ ) . Dhoni has beaten two major test nations Pakistan and South Africa , with a mediocre bowling attack and that too both times while defending totals ( Indian bowlers were not expected to defend any total this WC ) . And the way they thrashed a hot favorite team like SA for 130 runs , clearly tells that Dhoni has had a big hand in marshalling his ordinary bowling troops very effectively. SO FAR , MS Dhoni is the best captain of this tournament . wapuser on February 22 , 2015 , 20 : 00 GMT Mannix , please do n't compare test with Odi. Ganguly had a good team in 2003 world cup but what he did at final very stupid decision after winning the toss he elected to field. Also if you have a great team then SA might won world cup long back. It 's strategies and implementation. Currently we have a weak bowling attack with that he managed to 2 great wins and that too against SA incredible and dominance . No other captain had won 3 international tournaments conducted by ICC. it 's not that you agree him as best captain. History will tell and he already registered his name there. All the legends of cricket accepted him as one of the finest captain.so as an Indian let 's be proud of him and enjoy this moment. Come on India we all there to support you keep rocking. Jai hind ! ! ! on February 22 , 2015 , 19 : 33 GMT This Kiwis side is easily the best in this WC followed closely bu Australia. I expect the Kiwis to lift this cup like SL did in 1996 Mannix16 on February 22 , 2015 , 19 : 14 GMT Do n't know why people are claiming Dhoni is the best captain. Dhoni has the luxury of having one of the best batting sides in the world. Back in 2011 , he also had a great dearth of bowlers in home conditions too. His test captaincy is enough proof that he is overrated. To me , Ganguly was a way better captain than Dhoni. McCullum should be applauded for raising his own performances when he becomes a captain. He has had amazing Test and ODI stats when he is captaining NZ. To me , a good captain is someone who was almost unbeatable in his time ( Ricky Ponting ) or someone who won based on pure captaincy skills , even with a mediocre team ( Arjuna Ranatunga , Misbah Ul Haq ) . If Baz can keep up the performances , then I am sure he will be recognized up there with the greats . wapuser on February 22 , 2015 , 18 : 35 GMT Disagree... MAHI is the best captain in the CWC & not only in WC , he is the best captain in the world ! Thank u very much..pls come again later ! Ì†Ω Ì∏è wapuser on February 22 , 2015 , 18 : 12 GMT BMc team having a good bowlers. But MSD team not that much good even they are winning the match. Because of MSD. MSD is the good captain at present . dhruv_2694 on February 22 , 2015 , 16 : 42 GMT @ ESPNCRICINFOMOBILE FYI , NZ won against PAK in UAE , SA in SA , ENG in ENG and many more. All those wins come because of attacking captainship of BAZ.. So , I think he is best skipper among all current sides.. . Popular Videos
