World Cup 2015 news January 29 , 2015 Miller replaces Narine for West Indies ESPNcricinfo staff shares 56 Nikita Miller finds himself bound for Australia and New Zealand © WICB Media Nikita Miller , the left-arm spinner , has the task of filling Sunil Narine 's shoes at the World Cup after he was chosen as the replacement in West Indies ' squad . Narine withdrew from the tournament on Tuesday , little more than 48 hours after taking 6 for 9 in the Nagico Super50 final against Guyana , saying that his action still required more work after it was reported during last year 's Champions League T20 . Miller , 32 , has played 45 ODIs , the last of which came against England in March 2014 and has taken 40 wickets at 36.52. He is the second left-arm spinner in West Indies ' squad alongside Sulieman Benn. His call-up was approved by the ICC 's event technical committee , which has to rule on all replacement players which normally happen due to injury , and it was termed an " exceptional circumstance. " In the Nagico Super50 , Miller claimed six wickets in four matches , along with a frugal economy rate of 2.32 across his 40 overs , but there were other spin options above him in the wicket-taker 's list which was topped by Narine. Veerasammy Permaul , another left-armer , claimed 11 wickets at 13.36 with an outstanding economy rate of 3.12 . West Indies completed their tour of South Africa on Wednesday when they were heavily beaten in the final ODI at Supersport Park. Their opening World Cup match is against Ireland in Nelson on February 16 . © ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
