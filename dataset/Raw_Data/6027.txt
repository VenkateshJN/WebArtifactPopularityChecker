Starc too hot for Scotland Australia vs Scotland , 40th Match , Pool A Sat , Mar 14 2015 by CB Staff Mitchell Starc took 4-14 as Scotland folded for 130 Mitchell Starc bowled his way to the top of the leading wicket-taker 's chart ending with figures of four for 14 in under five overs to help bowl Scotland out for 130. Usually known for his full swinging thunderbolts , Starc double-guessed the Scottish batsman in his first spell with clever changes in length. He started by bowling 10 successive dot balls. Experienced Scotland batsman , Kyle Coetzer , who played all those 10 deliveries was particularly disconcerted by Starc 's probing off-side line. The eleventh delivery from Starc was on a good length , around the off-stump , took the outside edge and flew to Steven Smith at gully . If the first wicket was with a length delivery , the second was earned with a back of a length delivery , again outside the off-stump. Calum MacLeod 's attempted cut shot found Aaron Finch at backward point. Starc ended his first spell with figures of 4-1-14-2 ! Then came a four ball second-spell straight after the rain delay. Scotland , who had slipped to 130/8 by the 25th over found Starc 's pace too hot to handle . Josh Davey who 'd played well for his 26 got a full delivery , was late to bring his bat down and saw his off-stump knocked off. No. 11 Iain Wardlaw could n't do any better a couple of deliveries later. Another full and fast delivery and the off-stump had a deja-vu !
