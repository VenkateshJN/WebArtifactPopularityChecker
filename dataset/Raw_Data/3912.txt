" How old were you ? " he asks smiling , " I keep trying to forget that. " The Black Caps were on an unbelievable winning run , Larsen being one of the key figures in that team led by Martin Crowe . It was all going well till they met Pakistan in the semifinals. " Inzy ! What an innings , we had it all covered till then , " Larsen said , going back to that semifinal in Wellington. He is now an ICC-appointed official and the idea should be to stay neutral. But Larsen does n't mind another semifinal showdown with Pakistan. " Revenge is a great idea , is n't it ? I would n't mind if we end up meeting Pakistan again in the knockouts , " he said . For the last two years , a smooth running of the World Cup has been Larsen 's agenda and he has worked tirelessly towards it. " It 's been hard work , the team has put in a good effort and it 's good to see that everyone is feeling happy about the way it 's going , " the former international added . He is watching as many matches as he can and does n't mind naming his four semifinalists for the tournament. " Australia , New Zealand , South Africa and India. I think these four should be there in the last-four stage. After that it 's anybody 's game , " he laughed .
