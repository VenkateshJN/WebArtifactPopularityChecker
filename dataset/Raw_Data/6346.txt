Loading comments kaasu on January 17 , 2015 , 16 : 56 GMT Best format was 1992 when every major team had a chance to play against each other on January 17 , 2015 , 16 : 34 GMT I agree. The current World Cup will be one of the worst to be held , second only to the Caribbean edition back in 2007 when the tournament just kept going and going. People even wanted it to end desperately. In my opinion , the best World Cups were held in Asia including the 2011 edition. The format for this edition , as Dravid and co. put it is simply troubling given the fact , the top teams only need to focus on 3 games , the quarterfinals , the semis and the finals. The group stages is simply there to accommodate the minnows. I mean , why waste everyone 's time ICC ?
