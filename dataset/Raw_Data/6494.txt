5 0 35.1 to Taylor , 111.5 kph , slower ball first up , and they have appealed for a catch at the wicket. Dharmasena has gone to the third umpire with no soft signal this time. This is a slower legcutter , nearly a yorker , really really full. Taylor looks to drive , and the ball lobs to Haddin 's right. The umpires check on both counts : bump ball and a clean catch. Replays show the ball has pitched just before hitting Taylor 's bat , takes the outside edge , and the edge is soft , dying to Haddin 's right. He flies to his right , takes a stunning one-handed catch. This is a huge wicket. Clutch players strike first ball in the Powerplay 150/4 35.3 to Anderson , 133.0 kph , James Faulkner. He is a big player. That 's why Australia were desperate to get him fit. He is a clutch player. Both with bat and ball. He has been asked to come back in the Powerplay , and he has taken out two wickets in three balls. Slower ball to get Taylor out , followed by a normal pace length ball , and then a quick yorker. Anderson is slow on this. Beaten for pace. He has squeezed it past the bat. Rushes away towards point after hitting the off stump. On replay , this is not quite a yorker , but a really full ball that kisses the pad and hits off stump. He has done him in for pace. Slower ball was 112ks , this was 133ks 150/5 41.5 to Elliott , 110.2 kph , Faulkner has brought that one final big wicket. Slower ball does it again. It is so hard to pick because it comes out with the seam up. Elliot sees a length ball that he can hit over the leg side , but he is way too early into the shot. He gets the outside edge , and Faulkner 's back-of-the-hand slower ball always bounces extra , which means it carries to Haddin for yet another catch. Australia all over New Zealand. A bit of a send-off again , but he gets a generous applause from the full house. raises his bat to them 171/8
