Take care . @ cricketwallah : Spectacular turnaround by Afghanistan to win first World Cup match ! Their ascent as cricketing nation is among greatest stories in sport.. . @ irbishi : I feel for Scotland but that was another most compelling cricket match. Associates nations are providing so many highlights @ this CWC2015 . @ bhogleharsha : What a finish , what a thriller. Delighted for Afghanistan , but well played Scotland . @ cricketaakash : Super duper win for Afghanistan...there 's so much to like about the way they play their cricket @ G_Rajaraman : This win means a lot to all Afghanistan. Am told cricket unites the different strands of society there like nowhere else @ cricket_U : So in space of 24 hours we have seen two best games of the tournament , involving four Associate teams Let 's take a look at some of the interesting tweets from this game : Nabi : 'This is our first win of the World Cup , everyone has enjoyed this win. There was a lot of pressure and the boys did n't bat well in the middle. We threw away 4-5 wickets early. Sami ( Samiullah Shenwari ) just batted brilliantly and he took the pressure on himself and took the game till the end. It 's a good way of learning how to handle the pressure. We will work in the upcoming games and it 's good to put 2 points on the board with 3 games left. Everyone enjoyed and we hope that we win more games. We have got plenty of support in Australia and New Zealand. Back home too , everyone 's supporting us ( on the support they have received so far ) .' Mommsen : 'It is never easy losing a game , but this is particularly a difficult one for us. We knew what to expect and the type of cricket they play. We knew if we were patient upfront , get a couple of wickets and that might lead to a few more and that happened. We had them 7 down pretty early on. So , very disappointed we could n't finish them off. Obviously , we were always trying to take wickets , but we could n't. We wanted to get those 8,9 and 10 , but unfortunately , it just was n't to be.' Shenwari : 'I am happy that I had the strength to stand for Afghanistan. It was a big pressure situation because we lost lot of wickets quickly. So , my coach gave me the responsibility to stay at the wicket till the end. I did my job and I am happy. That was a very poor shot from me , but I was trying to hit more sixes to help us chase it down. Unfortunately , I middled the ball , but I do n't know why it did n't go over the boundary. It was a good win for us in the tournament to get 2 points and we are looking forward to win more games and qualify for the next stage.' Shenwari is the Man of the Match for his gritty 96 Berrington was the pick of the Scottish bowlers. He registered his career best figures , 4/40 in his 10 overs. Davey and Evans supported him well by scalping two wickets each. Haq as usual was at his slowest best , tossing the ball and keeping things tight at his end. He also kept his cool and snared the wicket of Shenwari in the 47th over. However , they could not keep Shenwari quiet when it mattered. Wardlaw had a forgettable day with the ball , he was also the one who bowled the final over of the innings . Nabi was given out LBW , he reviewed it and Hawk-Eye showed that it was just clipping the leg-stump. Zazai , Najibullah and Naib played some poor strokes and threw their wickets away. Shenwari kept battling at the other end , stitched another crucial partnership with Dawlat Zadran , who went for the glory shot just before the batting powerplay and got out. Hassan hung in there and Shenwari did all the scoring by farming most of the strike. The latter choose which bowler to attack and which bowler to defend , he deserved a hundred but fell four runs short. Shapoor and Hassan held their nerve to finish the game off. The former hit a couple of crucial blows , including the boundary that won them the game . Ahmadi got Afghanistan to a flier , he played some delightful strokes. Even though Mangal and Stanikzai fell cheaply , he carried on and added 39 runs with Shenwari. However , he threw it away just after reaching his 5th ODI fifty. That wicket opened the floodgates for the Scottish bowlers . For the Scottish players , this is heartbreaking. They looked extremely sad and were not in a mood to leave the field. Complete contrast for both the teams. Scotland 's captain Mommsen ca n't believe his luck , he is sitting right next to the track in sheer disappointment. Earlier , it was Scotland , who were delighted when Afghanistan were 97/7 at one stage. The way they turned things around to pull off an improbable win will give the Afghan players a lot of confidence going forward. They were ecstatic and why should n't they be , they have done a brilliant job of winning this game from nowhere. Shenwari started off slowly , but probably played the best and the most important knock of his life. His 96 was fabulous to say the least , lifting his team from a losing position to taking them very close to the win. He was unhappy that he could n't finish things off , but the tail-enders did the job for him. This was the best game of the World Cup so far , undoubtedly . 49.3 Iain Wardlaw to Shapoor , FOUR , Afghanistan have done it , Shapoor has won it for them , he dispatches this to the deep backward square leg fence , takes off his helmet and runs towards his team-mates , he then drops down on the ground , has his arms aloft in the air , Hamid Hassan comes and hugs him after he goes flat on the floor. These are emotional scenes for the Afghan team , their first ever win in a World Cup. A few players run onto the field and hug him. It has been a breathtaking encounter. Shenwari , who got out with 19 runs needed , breathes a sigh of relief . Shapoor has hurt his finger while putting in the dive. The physio is out there and tending to him. He seems to be fine. The game resumes after a slight delay.. . 49.2 Iain Wardlaw to Shapoor , no run , run-out chance missed !

The Zadrans and Hassan have bowled in the right areas for the most part , barring a few short and wide deliveries that were punished , all three wickets have been owned to poor footwork.

But there are a few Afghanistan supporters at deep cover , waving large Afghanistan flags in national attire. " 1.2 Dawlat Zadran to Coetzer , no run , jaffa ! Wasim Akram reckons it was a leg-break. Pitched on middle and shapes away , Coetzer is squared up as he plays down the wrong angle. The extra bounce on the wicket takes it over the stumps.

Coetzer is on strike. Shapoor will open the attack The national anthems of both teams are done. Nabi gathers his team in a huddle before they take the ground. The Scotland openers make their way out to the middle. Coetzer marks his guard as the countdown begins. We are all set for the game to start. Here we go. . Pitch Report : " It could just be a little bit tricky for the batsmen , how they manage the off-stump channel. But it looks more Scottish kind of conditions than Afghanistan because there is a lot of grass cover. Having said that , you can still score runs provided that you are disciplined , provided that you see off the new ball. The first 10 overs are going to be critical because there are patches of green , there is a thick layer of grass which must be alien to an Afghanistan cricketer. The average score is 240-250 , you should be looking to target that " , reckons Rameez Raja Teams : Afghanistan ( Playing XI ) : Javed Ahmadi , Nawroz Mangal , Asghar Stanikzai , Samiullah Shenwari , Mohammad Nabi ( c ) , Najibullah Zadran , Afsar Zazai ( w ) , Gulbadin Naib , Dawlat Zadran , Hamid Hassan , Shapoor Zadran Scotland ( Playing XI ) : Calum MacLeod , Kyle Coetzer , Hamish Gardiner , Matt Machan , Preston Mommsen ( c ) , Richie Berrington , Matthew Cross ( w ) , Josh Davey , Majid Haq , Alasdair Evans , Iain Wardlaw Afghanistan have won the toss and have opted to field Nabi : " The boys performed well in the last game and hopefully we can perform well in this game as well because the pitch is very good for fast bowling. We will bowl first. It is a totally fresh wicket and we will look to put pressure on the Scotland guys. We have a good fast bowling unit. In the practice session they were looking good and we will try to perform well in this game. Everyone is watching this , watching every game. In Afghanistan it is 2 : 30 in the night , but everyone is watching the game. " Mommsen : " I think the first two games , England and New Zealand , have put us in a better place. We have played a lot of cricket against Afghanistan and hopefully that will work for us today. We need to get some runs on the board and put them under pressure. I think it will remain pretty much the same the whole day. It will have something for us when we bowl. Upfront we need to be tight , we need to get runs on the board. We will have to assess. Obviously the start is fundamental. A partnership platform upfront to give ourselves a chance to get some runs at the back end. " Head-to-Head : These two teams have played quite a few times against each other. Afghanistan have the upper hand as they have won 5 out of those 8 games. Will they make it 6 today ? Or can Scotland beat them where it matters the most ? Stay tuned as the toss and teams are coming up in a short while.. . Scotland The bowling looks alright with Iain Wardlaw leading the pace attack. He is well supported by Alasdair Evans , Josh Davey and the spinner , Majid Haq. Haq was superb in the last game versus England , he slowed it down considerably and ended with figures of 1/51 in his 10 overs. They are a much better fielding side than Afghanistan and it might well turn out to be the difference today . Scotland 's first game was against the high flying Kiwis. The New Zealand bowlers used the swinging conditions in Dunedin to good effect as they bowled out Scotland for a paltry 142. Nonetheless , the bowlers did not give up easily as they scalped 7 wickets and made it a bit difficult for the Black Caps to reach the target. In the second game against England , the bowlers once again pulled things back after Moeen Ali 's century and were set a target of 304. However , the batting failed yet again. Apart from Kyle Coetzer , no one else showed the application which is needed to beat the big teams . Afghanistan The three pacers , Shapoor Zadran , Dawlat Zadran and Hamid Hassan have been absolutely brilliant. They have bowled with pace and hit the right areas. If only their batsmen could stand and deliver , Afghanistan will be a difficult team to beat. They will also have to improve their fielding , especially during pressure situations . Afghanistan started their campaign against familiar foes , Bangladesh. They were outplayed by the Tigers. Even though they restricted Bangladesh to 267 , the batsmen failed to get going and were rolled over for 162. Against Sri Lanka , they had a very good chance of registering their first win. After Mathews sent them in , Afghanistan batsmen did well to post a competitive 232. In reply , the Asian giants were stuttering at 51/4 before Mahela scored a brilliant hundred and eventually , Thisara Perera got them home with his power-hitting . Today 's game also promises to be a cracker. We can term it as the battle of equals. Afghanistan and Scotland come into this encounter with a couple of losses behind them. So , who will come out on top remains to be seen. Let us have a look at the form guide of both the teams . The battle between the Associate nations continues. Yesterday we saw the first close game of the competition and it was played between Ireland and UAE. After being reduced to 131/6 , UAE fought back through Shaiman Anwar 's hundred to post 278 on the board. Ireland looked down and out and would have lost the game had it not been for the pyrotechnics from Kevin O'Brien and Gary Wilson. Both scored their respective fifties and saw their side through . Preview On paper , the 17th match of the 2015 ICC World Cup appears little more than a battle for bragging rights between two of the tournament 's less-fancied teams. Neither Scotland or Afghanistan are expected to make it to the quarter-finals , but considering the ICC 's plan to shrink the World Cup to ten teams in 2019 and the reduction of opportunities for Associate nations to improve at the highest level , making as many ticks in the W column is of utmost importance to them . At every juncture of Scotland 's World Cup campaign , Preston Mommsen has found himself defending his team 's position as minnows. He has spoken of how they have nothing to prove because they won matches to qualify for the World Cup , but equally he has emphasised the importance of taking points home because of the make-up of the 2019 tournament. Scotland and Afghanistan have needed to win every match because there is so much riding on the success of the Associates . Scotland have lost both their matches , to New Zealand by three wickets and England by 119 runs , while Afghanistan lost to Bangladesh by 105 runs and Sri Lanka by four wickets. Yet both teams will know that victories were close in one each of their previous games , and that with a bit more runs , they could beat Full Member teams. Right here in Dunedin , Scotland had New Zealand seven wickets down chasing 143 and Afghanistan reduced Sri Lanka to 51 for 5 and then 178 for 6 when defending 233. More is needed , and the two sides should know just what that is . That Scotland have not been competitive enough so far in this World Cup owes largely because not enough players have delivered in tandem. Against New Zealand , from 12 for 4 the team was carried by Matt Machan 's 56 and Richie Berrington 's 50 , but the innings gave way once the pair was separated. Against England , barring Kyle Coetzer 's splendid 71 the next best contribution was Mommsen 's 26. The hard-hitting opener Calum MacLeod has yet to click , making 0 and 4 , and that has meant early pressure on the batting . Despite two defeats , Mommsen could take positives from the team 's performance , especially considering that apart from the offspinner Majid Haq , no member of the squad had played in a World Cup before this. " It 's been vital to get that experience under the belt and bank that. Obviously , it 's one thing talking about playing in a World Cup , but actually doing it , on the day there 's so much that goes on , there 's far more pressure , " he said . " But , I think we 're better for those two games and the experience of that , and I think we 've played good cricket in parts in both those games , but just not for long enough. I think England , the way we came back with the ball in the second half of the first innings was a great credit to our bowlers , to only restrict them to 300. I thought that was a brilliant effort. And with the bat we 've threatened at times , just , as I said , not being able to do those good things for long enough and get those bigger partnerships to have a proper crack at chasing those totals. We do take a lot from those first two games. " Scotland made two changes for the England game in Christchurch , swapping Hamish Gardiner and Rob Taylor with Freddie Coleman and Alasdair Evans. While Coleman made just 7 at No 3 , seamer Evans was the most economic Scotland bowler with 1 for 46 off his ten overs. It is likely that Coleman will be persisted with , because Gardiner doesnt have much form to show for . Afghanistan improved on 162 all out against Bangladesh by posting 232 against Sri Lanka , but they should have gotten more from a scoreline of 138 for 2 after 27 overs. The problem has been starts and finishes - the middle order has done well - and against Scotland , those are areas which they will hope to improve ahead of bigger tests with Australia , New Zealand and England. With allrounder Mirwais Ashraf injured and unlikely to recover for the game , one of Nasir Jamal and Gulbadin Naib could come in . " We learned a lot of things from the Sri Lanka game , and hopefully we are doing good against Scotland , " said Afghanistan opener Javed Ahmadi. " They are also one of the ICC Associate members and they 're doing good in this tournament , as well , so we will try our best and look forward. It 's very important for us , especially because both sides are Associate member , and hopefully we beat Scotland strongly. That would be very good because we 're showing our country. " The two teams have played each other eight times in ODIs , with Afghanistan holding a 5-3 advantage over Scotland. During the Dubai Triangular Series played in January , the two results between the teams were contrasting : in the first , Afghanistan chased down 238 with eight wickets and 42 balls remaining but in the second , set 214 , they were bowled out for 63 in 18.3 overs . Mommsen felt that the last match would be added inspiration for Scotland. " We take a huge amount of confidence from that game in Abu Dhabi , huge psychological advantage , I think. We had a clear , clear strategy and tactic against them , and I 'm pretty sure that we 'll resort to the same formula tomorrow , " he said. " In terms of our approach to Afghanistan , yes , I think you will see a slightly different approach in the way we play. Generally , a Scotland-Afghanistan game is quite feisty and there 's quite a bit of passion on display , quite a bit of aggression , and I think tomorrow will be no different. " Wednesday afternoon was chilly , with temperatures dropping to 12 degrees as drizzle fell on the city , but the forecast for game day is only marginally better. The overcast conditions and Dunedin 's Scottish heritage , hoped Mommsen , would work in Scotland 's favour. " We 're hoping this would almost be like a home game for us with the support that we 'll hopefully have tomorrow , " he said. " We 're used to playing against Afghanistan in the UAE where they have thousands and thousands of support , and that genuinely does make a difference for the way they play. Hopefully for once we 'll have more support than they 'll have , and that 'll give us an extra edge.
