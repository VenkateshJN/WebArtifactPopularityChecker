Who was the best bowler in the third and fourth innings ? The Statsguru Awards go beyond runs scored , wickets taken , or averages , and are the result of detailed data analyses of performances. ESPNcricinfo 's ball-by-ball data analysis of every international game has answers to these queries and more .
