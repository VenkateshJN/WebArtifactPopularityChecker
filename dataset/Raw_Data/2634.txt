Gujarat came up with an impressive team effort to edge out Saurashtra and hence booked Syed Mustaq Ali T20 Super League berth . With two wins and one loss , both the teams needed a win to seal the second place behind the mighty Mumbai . And Gujarat players fired in unison with opener Priyank Panchal starting off with a 31-ball 41 to give Gujarat the base which Manprit Juneja built on with 32-ball 44 . Chirag Gandhi ( 23-ball 38 ) and Jesal Karia ( 14-ball 27 ) added some quick-fire runs to help their team post a challenging 182 for seven in 20 overs . Saurashtra 's in-form openers , Sheldon Jackson ( 29-ball 38 ) and Cheteshwar Pujara ( 19-ball 23 ) , took Gujarat 's medium pacers to task as they added 61 runs in 7.3 overs . But offie Jesal Karia gave Gujarat the breakthrough -with the important wicket of Pujara -in the eighth over and young left-arm spinner Hardik Patel outsmarted Sheldon in the next over , there was no stopping the Gujarat bowlers . Jaydev Shah only flattered to deceive as Hardik and Jesal , along with Rush Kalaria , ran through Saurashtra 's middle-order. Jasprit Bumrah took care of the lower-order as Gujarat restricted Saurashtra to 149 for nine in 20 overs to win the match .
