BCCI wanted Patil to go to Australia and watch Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men defend the title , but he declined to go as he felt that his role as well as that of his co-selectors ended once they had picked the Cup squad , informed sources said . " He felt it was more helpful to watch domestic cricket , with the Ranji Trophy reaching its climax , than go to Australia for the World Cup. This is in total contrast to what has happened in Pakistan , " the sources said . Interestingly , Pakistan 's selection panel chief Moin Khan has got into trouble with the country 's cricket board ( PCB ) following media revelations that he had visited a casino during his stay in Australia .
