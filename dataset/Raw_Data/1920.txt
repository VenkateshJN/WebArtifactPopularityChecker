Crunch game for Rajasthan Royals , RCB K Shriniwas Rao K Shriniwas Rao,TNN | Apr 26 , 2014 , 09.53 AM IST RCB are fresh from a shocker of a defeat in their previous encounter , which they thought they 'd almost won before a stunning catch in the last over changed it all. ( PTI Photo ) RELATED DUBAI : The Rajasthan Royals and the Royal Challengers Bangalore both find themselves in a quandary ahead of their encounter at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Saturday. Regardless of where they stand in the points table , both sides are coming out from a defeat in their previous game . The Royals are fresh from a batting debacle in their previous match , which they should have won chasing 140 against Chennai Super Kings. In contrast , the Challengers are fresh from a shocker of a defeat in their previous encounter , which they thought they 'd almost won before a stunning catch in the last over changed it all . After indications that Chris Gayle would finally play his first match on Thursday , which the Jamaican did not , there 's been no further update on his availability for Saturday 's encounter either. If he does figure in the XI , it 'll only add to the pressure for Rajasthan , who 've lost two matches already . The big question for RCB , though , is in whose place can they bring in Gayle ? Among the overseas batsmen in the side , AB de Villiers is irreplaceable and so is Albie Morkel , who lends great all-round value . Dropping Muthiah Muralitharan is a tough call simply because of the experience he lends to the RCB attack. So is the case with Aussie pacer Mitchell Starc . RCB have no choice but to go in with a bowler less and use Gayle 's part-time spin if and when the West Indies batsman is ready to play . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Royal Challengers Bangalore,Rajasthan Royals,Chris Gayle,Albie Morkel,AB de Villiers Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
