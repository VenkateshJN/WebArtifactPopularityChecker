The West Indies has won thrice and six matches have ended in draw. 10 - In South Africa , it is far more one-sided with the home side leading 10-1 and one match drawn.

But the team lost to Australia by 281 runs in February this year. 13 of the 19 captains to win the toss at the ground have chosen to field first. 1st - This is South Africa ’ s first home Test since the retirement of Graeme Smith and Jacques Kallis . 2 - AB de Villiers is ranked second in the World in the Reliance ICC Rankings for Test Batsmen.

He has 68 wickets at 21.77 in his last 14 matches. 1 - Irrespective of how the Australia-India series pans out , if South Africa wins the series , it will be guaranteed top spot in the ICC Rankings . Team News JP Duminy has a knee injury which has probably ruled him out of the entire series. Stiaan van Zyl is expected to make his Test debut in place of Duminy at No. 7. Robin Peterson has been recalled to the South African squad as Dane Piedt is recovering from a shoulder injury. Lions duo Temba Bavuma , a top-order batsman , and Kagiso Rabada , a 19-year-old seamer , are in the South Africa squad for the first time . Darren Bravo has opted out of the tour for personal reasons and Chris Gayle is missing due to a lower back injury. The West Indies will therefore rely on Marlon Samuels , who hit a double-century in a warm-up match last week , and the World ’ s Number 3 ranked batsman , Shivnarine Chanderpaul. Devon Smith could play his first Test since May 2011. He averages 24.71 with just one century from 33 Tests. Left-arm fast bowler Sheldon Cottrell - a private in the Jamaican Defence Force - has been added to a seam department that includes Kemar Roach , Shannon Gabriel and Jason Holder. Cottrell took five wickets in the tour match and could make his Test Match debut . Similar Articles
