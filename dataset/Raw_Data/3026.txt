Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 Both the senior players had announced they would retire from one-day cricket after the World Cup with skipper Misbah continuing to play Tests while Afridi will feature in Twenty20 cricket . Misbah , 40 , failed to get a one-day hundred in his entire career of 162 one-day internationals. His final run tally was 5,122 runs -- the most runs by any player in one-dayers without a hundred . The captain managed 34 in Pakistan 's sub-par total of 213 all out against Australia at the Adelaide Oval . The co-hosts overhauled the target in 33.5 overs for a comprehensive six-wicket victory , earning a place in next Thursday 's semifinal against defending champions India in Sydney .

Afridi , 35 , who scored 8,064 runs in his 398 one-day internationals , could have been the only allrounder with over 8,000 one-day runs and 400 wickets .
