Gambhir and Rohit still in waiting list The author has posted comments on this article Sumit Mukherjee , TNN | Jul 16 , 2014 , 08.59AM IST It is particularly tough for Gambhir and Rohit who , get a late call-up to bat in the nets when the bowlers were all tired. ( Reuters Photo ) Page 1 of 4 LONDON : It is hard to be a reserve player on a long tour. The Indian team management , which has brought a record 18 players to England this time , is hardly being able to do justice to the reserves . With the regulars crowding the nets , the fringe players have been forced to either turn their arms over , or take refuge in one of the outer nets and do some light knocking with someone from the support staff chucking a few balls at them . It is particularly tough for reserve batsmen like Gautam Gambhir and Rohit Sharma who , along with Wriddhiman Saha , got a late call-up to bat in the nets when the bowlers were all tired. The team management can hardly be faulted for bringing such a large contingent after the team 's horrible run-in with injuries on the 2011 tour . At least nine players broke down in course of that four-Test series in which India were whitewashed. The situation had become so acute that India had to fly in RP Singh , who was holidaying in USA . Anderson set to surpass Botham James Anderson needs just two more wickets to surpass England legend Ian Botham as the highest wicket-taker at Lord 's. In his glittering career , Botham captured 69 wickets at this venue where swing bowlers have traditionally reaped dividends . Anderson has 68 wickets to his credit at the venue where he and Broad have combined to bring about the downfall of 93 batsmen. More records are sure to tumble .
