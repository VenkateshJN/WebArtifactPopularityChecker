Last updated on Monday , 02 March , 2015 15 : 16 IST Total Shares Rangana Herath leaves the field against England in the World Cup . Â© AFP Sydney : Sri Lanka great Muttiah Muralitharan pleaded on Monday for key spinner Rangana Herath to be kept on ice for the World Cup quarter-finals after suffering a nasty injury to his finger. ( Complete World Cup Coverage ) The 36-year-old Herath needed four stitches in the spinning finger of his left hand after he tried to stop a full-blooded drive from England 's Jos Buttler in Wellington on Sunday . Sri Lanka won the match by nine wickets and with the 1996 champions almost assured of a quarter-final spot , record wicket-taker Muralitharan believes Herath can safely be rested for the remaining pool games against Australia in Sydney next Sunday and with Scotland in Hobart three days later . " He has been Sri Lanka 's steadiest and most reliable bowler so far in the tournament , " wrote Muralitharan in his International Cricket Council ( ICC ) column . Should Herath be ruled out , as is likely , the main spinning duties will pass to Sachithra Senanayake who was included in the squad after his bowling action was cleared by the ICC . " I would not try to rush Herath back , either for the match with Australia or for the clash with Scotland , " added Muralitharan . " An injury like the one he has picked up to his spinning finger needs time to heal so I would allow him the maximum time to recover.
