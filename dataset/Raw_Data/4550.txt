Match in Pics | Points Table On Tuesday , Ireland made a flying start after William Porterfield had won the toss , reaching 89 before losing their first wicket from the final ball of the 15th over . They were then stifled by the Indian spinners , with Dhoni using Suresh Raina 's off spin to back up Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja , and were eventually dismissed for an inadequate 259 with an over to spare . Dhoni said later it was crucial to be flexible over his tactics and he would have introduced spin close to the fourth over had it been a must-win match for his team . " The few slower ones that were bowled definitely got a bit of bounce and the ball gripped on the surface. So in a really crucial game for us the spinners would have come in really early , " he told the post-match news conference . Dhoni said the new ball was coming on nicely to the bat , which was a good learning curve for his fast bowlers . " Maybe in the next game we will do it slightly different. I think when we play in Auckland the wicket will be very different. This ( Seddon Park ) is the slowest New Zealand wicket that you will see , " he said . Dhoni praised the bowling of Ashwin , whose first eight overs cost only 19 runs . " I have pushed him to bowl in the power plays and to use him in difficult situations. He 's very confident about his bowling , he understands his bowling well. The good thing about him is he keeps improving , " Dhoni said . " It 's obviously good to have him and he 's bowling very well.
