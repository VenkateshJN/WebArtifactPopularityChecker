Loading comments swarzi on January 26 , 2015 , 14 : 25 GMT ALEXK400 , the only time that stats lie , is when they are quoted from unreliable sources ! Understand ? And even though I have access to much more cricket stats than ESPN/Cricinfo has , I check others with their 's first every time that I use them , for verification. And one thing that I can recommend to the whole world about ESPN/Cricinfo , 'they have some of the most accurate and reliable cricket stats among the entities that compile cricket records in the world'. Hence , all that I wrote earlier about Rohit Sharma can be checked via ESPN/Cricinfo stats guru , for the truth. Also , yes , in his first 7 ODI innings in SA , Sachin Tendulkar could only cross 23 once , and avged only 20.6. The pace of Donald and Co. was too hot for him ; as he like all former Indian batsmen ( barring Gavascar and Dravid who rode it well ) was never good at negotiating the short ball either. It was short bowling in the 2007 WC in WI why Sachin et al were sent packing back to India - not even surviving the preliminaries . on January 25 , 2015 , 15 : 23 GMT Rahul Dravid is spot on about Rohit Sharma.. . on January 25 , 2015 , 3 : 51 GMT Alexk400 If the Wicket was really like a road then why all other batsmen scored below 20 runs ? why Aaron Finch an attacking batsman took 130 deliveries to score his 97 ? why Australia took 49 overs and 7 wickets to chase a mere 268 ? why no one mocked Sachin when he scored his only 100 on Flat SCG ? Melbourne is bouncier than any of the Indian or English Pitches and Please dont underrate one of the best innings played by an Indian in Australia Alexk400 on January 25 , 2015 , 2 : 04 GMT @ swarzi Stat sometime tells a lie. It hides the context. Average in useless matches when there is no pressure amount to nothing. When series on balance then you score big in chasing..its weight in gold. Kohli does every other day. That is why he is best batsman in the world better than amla and devillers. Kohli is in steroid if he is captain. I think rohit sharma issue is confidence and also someone needs to kick him regularly in the back. I think opening is best spot for him. Because once he he past first 10 overs of swining ball , he is in for century because he can build an inning. Playing him anywhere else with all his failures is no use. By opening he can play more productive role than anywhere else in winning a game . swarzi on January 24 , 2015 , 15 : 24 GMT Cont 'd : So , what I really was saying in my earlier post is that , apart from that little trough on a short tour to South Africa , Rohit Sharma 's average away from home , playing in the traditional countries is a whopping 64.9 - that is 43 % more than his next best positional average ! Now , if that does n't qualify him to own the spot to face the new ball , more than any other position , I do n't know what will . swarzi on January 24 , 2015 , 15 : 06 GMT A little research into the statistical facts to help to present a convincing argument as to where Rohit Sharma should bat reveals these figures : He has opened the inngs away from home ; and off the subcontinent 22 times and played on the soil of the other 5 traditional teams ( not Zim ) . His avge away from home in those countries is a whopping 54.7. In Aus , his avge is 138 ; in WI : 54.3 ; in New Zea : 35.5 ; in Eng : 31.6 and in SA : 14.0. After the opening position , his next best avge is 45 at No.5 - but in none of the other 5 positions is his avge more than 31. So , apart from SA where he has an apparent questionable but disputable poor performance ( based on the fact that he only toured there once , and batted 3 times ) , his avge as opener is par or better than most other ODI batsmen. But SA is not the easiest place to bat on your first tour. Tendulkar 's ODI average in 7 inngs on his first tour was 20.6 , passing 23 once for a top score of 32. Let 's stop this 'just say what you feel analysis' Selfishkar on January 24 , 2015 , 13 : 48 GMT How is Virat Kholi world 's premier all-rounder when people like ABD and Amla around ? This like saying Sachin was match-winner in do or die games . Alexk400 on January 24 , 2015 , 11 : 19 GMT Rohit actually useless outside india. He got lucky in his last match because wicket was a road. We have yet to see him play in swinging condition. Opening or number 4 do not make difference to him. Anyone who says this only trying to create excuse why he failed as opener in worldcup. if he played 4 and failed they will say he is good as opener. They are probably few of his fans. He got license to fail 10 successive matches now. Then he make another 80 and get pass for another 10 matches. Just plain lucky guy . on January 24 , 2015 , 10 : 54 GMT Yes , ca n't someone in the Indian Team management see it ? Rohit is a middle-order batsman ! Play him at No 4 ; we saw him take responsibility when he was the Mumbai Indians captain. Give him # 4 and a long rope at it - he will be a fine player. He 'll be smacking the bowling in the last 10 overs. Rahane is a much better opener - great technique. He 's not suited at # 4 though. Which is why Kohli is having to drop to # 4 ; while he just loves getting in at # 3 and taking charge . jimbond on January 24 , 2015 , 7 : 34 GMT I agree with Rahul. And In India 's context , I would love to see Rohit Sharma slightly lower down the order. It would be great to have Kohli , Sharma , Raina , Dhoni at numbers 3,4,5,6. The problem then would be the opening partnership. If Rahane can open , then it would be a fine thing. They badly need Dhawan to do well. People often underestimate the importance of Dhawan. If Dhawan does well , he transfers all the pressure to the opposition , and which is why they are probably giving him a long rope- hoping that he turns around his form .
