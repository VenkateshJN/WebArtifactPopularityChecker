Clarke bonds with Afghan cricketers Perth , Mon , Mar 02 2015 by Tanmoy Mookherjee Last updated on Monday , 02 March , 2015 , 12 : 01 PM Michael Clarke had a light-hearted chat with the Afghan players . You could excuse majority of the Australian players to have ignored the presence of their opponents from Afghanistan as they marched into the team 's training session at the WACA ground . A smattering of Indian media , deep in conversation with the Afghan players who had finished their practice saw their hosts walk by them without any greetings exchanged. After all , they had played each other just once three years ago and do n't cross paths much . While speaking with Afghanistan allrounder Gulbadeen Naib , Australian players Brad Haddin , Steven Smith and James Faulkner passed him but there was no attempt to break the ice . It was only later that Australia captain Michael Clarke walked down the steps into the ground and cheerfully greeted 5-6 Afghan players who were being interviewed by the broadcasters. He was seen having a chat with them in cheerful fashion . After having a brief chat with Gulbadeen , Clarke joined up with the players for a segment in the video where one Afghanistan player was interviewing another with arms wrapped around. It definitely made for pleasant viewing . Dismissive they might be on the field , but ignorant they are not. Australia are smarting from a defeat to New Zealand and want to make a statement to their much less-fancied rivals , but Afghanistan 's players were n't holding anything back . Only earlier , while Mitchell Johnson was back at his home ground and chose not to train with the rest of his team-mates , he did go into the dressing room before leaving with a big pile of books and training clothes in hand and chose to take walks around the park . Could be a sign of things to come . Â© Cricbuzz Tags
