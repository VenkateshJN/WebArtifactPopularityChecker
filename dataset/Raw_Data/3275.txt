( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 MELBOURNE : India 's listless bowling attack took a massive hammering as Australian skipper Steve Smith led magnificently with a 192-run knock to guide his team to a mammoth first innings total of 530 at tea on the second day of the third Test on Saturday . At the Melbourne Cricket Ground , Smith scored a career-best 192 runs ( 305 balls , 15 fours , 2 fours ) as the visitors let slip the pressure built on Day one and completely surrendered to the batting display . For India , R Ashwin ( 3-134 ) was the best bowler on display , bowling with control throughout the innings. Mohammad Shami ( 4-138 ) took the most wickets , but he was also the worst bowler on display , smacked for 23 fours , 13 more than any other bowler . Ishant Sharma ( 0-104 ) and Umesh Yadav ( 3-130 ) were unimpressive on this day with Murali Vijay ( 0-14 ) being the only other bowler used in this innings . Post-lunch , Smith looked to get some quick runs with Ryan Harris ( 74 runs , 88 balls , 8 fours , 1 six ) . India , meanwhile , merely waited for things to happen , almost reluctant to get the batsmen out . The latter made good use of the same and scored his third Test half-century , getting there off 75 balls. With Smith , he put on 106 runs for the 8th wicket as the visitors continued to bleed runs . All their front-line bowlers conceded more than 100 runs , a fact cheered by much gusto by the MCG crowd. Smith meanwhile continued to motor along , getting to the 150-run mark for the second time in this series , reaching there in the 133rd over. He stepped up the run-rate thereafter , scoring his next 42 runs off only 32 balls . Harris was out LBW to Ashwin in the 136th over of the innings and thereafter , Smith added a quick-fire 48 runs for the ninth wicket with Nathan Lyon ( 11 ) who threw his bat around . They were then both bowled by Shami in successive overs , 142nd and 144th , as the hapless Indian bowling and fielding effort on Day two came to an end. Josh Hazlewood ( 0 ) was the unbeaten batsman . Earlier , the hosts broke through India 's resistance on Day one and marched ahead in the morning session as Smith struck his third successive hundred of this Test series . The day started with Australia placed at 259/5 overnight , with Smith and Brad Haddin ( 55 runs , 84 balls , 7 fours , 1 six ) . The Indian bowlers would have looked to maintain their consistency from but they erred on their line and length , resorting to short-ball tactic almost immediately. Haddin made full use of the same as he raced to his half-century off 75 balls , scoring 29 runs off 25 balls in the morning 's play . The score also sped as a result and the first nine overs cost India 52 runs. The 50-run partnership for the sixth wicket came up in the 92nd over and then Haddin 's 18th Test fifty came up three overs later . At the other end , Smith remained solid as ever , bringing up 2000 career runs playing in his 25th Test. A little later , Australia crossed the 300-mark in the 97th over and three overs later their 100-run partnership came up . Following up his scores of 162 not out at Adelaide and 133 at Brisbane , Smith brought up his seventh Test hundred in the 101st over of the innings then . He got to the milestone off 191 balls , and in doing so , emulated Vijay Hazare , Jackie McGlew , Sunil Gavaskar and Alastair Cook as the ones to score hundreds in their first two Tests as captain . In that same over , against the run of play , Haddin was out caught behind edging a delivery he looked to leave off Shami. But this did n't bring any respite to the Indians as Mitchell Johnson ( 28 runs , 37 balls , 5 fours ) came to the crease . Australia maintained a run-rate of more than five-per-over through this morning session , scoring 130 runs in just 25 overs . Ashwin was introduced late into the attack , and just as on day one , he was able to apply some brakes. He also managed to get Johnson out stumped in the 112th over but Harris stayed with his skipper until the break . Australia had won the first Test in Adelaide by 48-runs and then the second Test in Brisbane by four-wickets to take a 2-0 lead in the four-match series .
