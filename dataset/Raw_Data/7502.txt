Glenn McGrath accounted for three of South Africa 's most obdurate batsmen , and ended the 2007 semi-final inside the first ten overs shares Play 02 : 57 History suggested it would be a close encounter , possibly even a classic , but in the end the second semi-final turned into a cakewalk for Australia thanks to a typically understated spell of seam bowling from Glenn McGrath . South Africa were keen to take the fight to their opponents but they were on the wrong foot. They had lost Graeme Smith , who had charged Nathan Bracken in the third over to be bowled . If ever a Jacques Kallis-like innings was needed , it was now. The ball was swinging , and the South Africa late order was packed with power-hitters. But South Africa , who had acquired a reputation for inflexibility both in their bowling and thinking , had obviously made up their minds that the only way to put pressure on Australia was to go hard at them . Kallis , who despite being their highest scorer in the World Cup had been criticised for not stepping up a gear or two , seemed to choose this game as the one in which to repair his reputation , with disastrous results. He made room and advanced down the track , but he had chosen the wrong man to target. McGrath coolly fired in an inch-perfect yorker and it clattered onto the stumps . Shaun Tait , bowling a memorable spell at the other end , removed AB de Villiers before McGrath sealed the deal. Even when he bowled a poor ball he claimed a wicket - Ashwell Prince , chasing a delivery that would have been called wide. The next ball was the complete opposite : perfect line and length outside off stump , bringing a thick edge to first slip from Mark Boucher . Justin Kemp survived the hat-trick delivery but the stunned expressions on South Africa 's balcony told the story. South Africa had lost half their side with less than 30 on the board , and McGrath had accounted for three of their most obdurate batsmen . Â© ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
