Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 Bangladesh though were set for a bigger score but the wickets of Shakib and Rahim not only stirred a collapse but gave the Afghan bowlers a new lease of life as Mashrafe Mortaza and company lost 5 wickets for just 34 runs in the last five overs of the innings . Earlier , an inspired spell of bowling from Mirwais Ashraf ( 2-32 ) saw Afghanistan push Bangladesh on the backfoot as the medium-pacer sent openers Anamul Haque and ( 29 ) Tamim Iqbal ( 19 ) back in the hut early . Soumya Sarkar ( 28 ) and Mahmudullah ( 23 ) then tried to take stock of the situation only to see Shapoor Zadran ( 2-20 ) strike back with another set of wickets . The tall new-ball bowler trapped Sarkar lbw for 28 and soon got Mahmudullah caught behind for 23 as the Afghan fans went crazy . Shakib and Rahim though thwarted all Afghan plans as the duo mixed the right dose of caution and aggression to bring some sanity to the innings . Shakib , registering his 27th ODI fifty , hit six fours and a six in his 51-ball stay while Rahim , notching up his 19th ODI half-century , also hit six fours and a six during his 56-ball blitz . The duo also managed to eke out 48 runs from the powerplay overs between 36-40 . But the Afghans never lost focus as the Mohammad Nabi-led side came back in the 45th over to see pace spearhead Hamid Hassan ( 2-61 ) clean up dangerman Shakib and bowl out Sabbir Rahman ( 3 ) in his very next over . Mortaza struck a 9-ball 14 but medium-pacer Aftab Alam ( 2-55 ) clean bowled him. The tail could n't survive the disciplined bowling as the No.11 Taskin Ahmed ( 1 ) fell on the last delivery of the innings .
