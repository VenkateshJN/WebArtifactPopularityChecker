Last updated on Wednesday , 18 February , 2015 17 : 53 IST Total Shares Mushfiqur dug Bangladesh out of the hole with a compact knock Â© Getty Images Canberra : Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim struck resilient half-centuries as Bangladesh got past a fighting Afghanistan by 105 runs in their opening pool match of the cricket World Cup , here on Wednesday. ( Scorecard | Blog ) Shakib ( 63 off 51 balls ) and Rahim ( 71 off 56 balls ) lifted Bangladesh to 267 after they were struggling at 119 for four. In the process , the two shared a fifth-wicket partnership of 114 runs to take the Tigers to a competitive total . In reply , the Afghans were bundled out for a meagre 162 in 42.5 overs . They had far from an ideal start as the Afghans lost three wickets for as many runs on the board. Nawroz Mangal ( 27 ) and Samiullah Shenwari ( 42 ) steadied the boat for a while , putting on 62 runs for the fourth wicket . After Mangal and Shenwari 's got dismissed in quick succession , leaving Afghanistan reeling at 78 for five again , skipper Mohammad Nabi and Najibullah Zadran ( 17 ) shared 58 runs for the sixth wicket to keep the hopes of the team from war-torn nation alive . But just when Bangladesh were preparing to press the panic button , Mashrafe Mortaza sent the Afghanistan captain back for a well-made 43-ball 44 that include five boundaries with the last ball of the over , while Shakib-al-Hasan dismissed Zardan with the first ball of the very next over to virtually end their hopes of making a comeback . With the scorecard reading 136 for seven , it was just a matter of time before Afghanistan innings folded . Although Mirwais Ashraf ( 10 ) and Aftab Alam ( 14 ) tried hard to apply themselves the Bangladesh bowlers tightened the nooze . For Bangladesh , Mortaza was the pick of the bowlers with figures of three for 20 , while Shakib took two for 43 . Earlier , electing to bat , Bangladesh were set for a bigger score , but the wickets of Shakib and Rahim not only stirred a collapse but gave the Afghan bowlers a new lease of life as Mortaza and company lost five wickets for just 34 runs in the last five overs of the innings . An inspired spell of bowling from Mirwais Ashraf ( 2/32 ) saw Afghanistan push Bangladesh on the backfoot as the medium-pacer sent openers Anamul Haque and ( 29 ) Tamim Iqbal ( 19 ) back in the hut early . Soumya Sarkar ( 28 ) and Mahmudullah ( 23 ) then tried to take stock of the situation only to see Shapoor Zadran ( 2/20 ) strike back with another set of wickets . The tall new-ball bowler trapped Sarkar lbw for 28 and soon got Mahmudullah caught behind for 23 as the Afghan fans celebrated like crazy . Shakib and Rahim though thwarted all Afghan plans as the duo mixed the right dose of caution and aggression to bring some sanity to the innings . Shakib , registering his 27th ODI fifty , hit six fours and a six in his 51-ball stay while Rahim , notching up his 19th ODI half-century , also hit six fours and a six during his 56-ball blitz . The duo also managed to eke out 48 runs from the powerplay overs between 36-40 . But the Afghans never lost focus as the Mohammad Nabi-led side came back in the 45th over to see pace spearhead Hamid Hassan ( 2/61 ) clean up dangerman Shakib and bowl out Sabbir Rahman ( 3 ) in his very next over . Mortaza struck a nine-ball 14 but medium-pacer Aftab Alam ( 2/55 ) clean bowled him. The tail could n't survive the disciplined bowling as the No.11 Taskin Ahmed ( 1 ) fell on the last delivery of the innings .
