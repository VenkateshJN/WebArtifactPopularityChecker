England players dominate World Cup 's flop XI Mon , Mar 30 2015 by Gokul Gopal Last updated on Tuesday , 31 March , 2015 , 12 : 00 PM Flops of ICC Cricket World Cup 2015. © Cricbuzz The beauty of sport is that it provides everyone with an equal chance. While some go on to make a big name for themselves , failure too is part of the game. In the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 , some emerged as big stars for their team while quite a few failed to make their presence felt. The biggest flop of them all was the England team , which failed to make it to the knock-out stages after their dismal showing. There was a temptation to include the entire England team in the Cricbuzz Flop XI , but we had to give other teams their fair due too. Here 's a look at eleven of the biggest flops of the # CWC15 ( Min. four matches ) : Eoin Morgan ( capt ) © Getty Scores : 0 v AUS , 17 v NZ , 46 v SCOT , 27 v SL , 0 v BAN , DNB v AFG . Total runs : 90. Average : 18.00 . Nothing went right for the England team in the World Cup and at the forefront of their abysmal run was their skipper , who had a tournament to forget. Taking over the ODI captaincy duties from Alastair Cook on a short notice , Morgan the skipper struggled to keep his unit together , while the Irish left-hander 's form dipped to new lows as a batsman . Dwayne Smith © Getty Scores : 18 v IRE , 23 v PAK , 0 v ZIM , 31 v SA , 6 v IND , 15 v UAE . Total runs : 93. Average : 15.50 . A powerful striker of the ball , terrific hand-eye co-ordination , ability to change the game in a matter of moments - these are some of the attributes that can be associated with West Indies opener Dwayne Smith. He was supposed to be the ideal foil for another hard-hitter in Chris Gayle and was expected to raise fear in the opposition ranks. However , ability does not always translate into result and Smith was the perfect example of that . Tamim Iqbal © Getty Scores : 19 v AFG , 0 v SL , 95 v SCO , 2 v ENG , 13 v NZ , 25 v IND . Total runs : 154. Average : 25.66 . Bangladesh 's batting mainstay Tamim was expected to play a key role at the top of the order. While his ODI form before the start of the tournament was n't all that great , a knock of 81 against Pakistan in the warm-ups would have given both the opener and his team a lot of confidence. However , the left-hander failed to make it count , registering a string of low scores , while his only good performance with the bat came against Scotland . Quinton de Kock ( wk ) © Getty Scores : 7 v ZIM , 7 v IND , 12 v WI , 1 v IRE , 0 v PAK , 26 v UAE , 78 * v SL , 14 v NZ . Total runs : 145. Average : 20.71. Catches : 9 , Stumpings : 0 . AB de Villiers could have kept wickets , but he preferred having de Kock as the frontline wicketkeeper-batsman in the team. The skipper had the confidence in the youngster backed him despite his repeated failures. While the 22-year-old did fire in the knock-out game against Sri Lanka , his overall performance left a lot to be desired . Gary Ballance Scores : 10 v AUS , 10 v NZ , 10 v SCO , 6 v SL . Total runs : 36. Average : 9.00 . While limited-overs specialists like Alex Hales and Ravi Bopara got limited opportunities , Gary Ballance was given an extended run , a move that came under a lot of criticism. While he has made his presence felt in the Test arena , the 50-over format did not seem like Ballance 's cup of tea as he failed repeatedly. What was even more surprising was the England team 's decision to persist with him despite the fact that he did not play a single ODI in the series against Sri Lanka and the tri-series involving India and Australia before the World Cup . Mahela Jayawardene © Getty Scores : 0 v NZ , 100 v AFG , DNB v BAN , DNB v ENG , 19 v AUS , 2 v SCO , 4 v SA . Total runs : 125. Average : 25 . As far as swansongs go , Jayawardene was one among few whose final World Cup appearance did not turn out to be a memorable one. While he managed to score a hundred against Afghanistan , it was a dull World Cup otherwise for the veteran Sri Lankan , whose farewell was contrasting to that of his cricketing brother Kumar Sangakkara , who had a tournament to remember . Shahid Afridi © Getty Scores and bowling figures : 22 and 0/50 v IND , 28 and 0/48 v WI , 0 and 0/53 v ZIM , 21 * and 2/35 v UAE , DNB and 0/38 v IRE , 23 and 0/30 v AUS . Total Runs : 116. Batting Average : 23.30. Total Wickets : 2. Bowling Average : 141.00. Economy : 4.94 . He was Pakistan 's hero in the 2011 World Cup , winning one match after another single-handedly. However , his last ODI tournament turned out to be a damp squib. He hardly made his presence felt be it with ball or bat . Ravindra Jadeja © Getty Scores and bowling figures : 3 and 1/56 v PAK , 2 and 1/37 v SA , DNB and 2/23 v UAE , 13 and 2/27 v WI , DNB and 1/45 v IRE , DNB and 0/71 v ZIM , 23 and 2/42 v BAN , 16 and 0/56 v AUS . Total Runs : 57. Batting Average : 14.25. Total Wickets : 9. Bowling Average : 39.66. Economy : 5.35 . The Indian skipper 's blue-eyed boy , Jadeja returned to the Indian camp for the World Cup after missing the disappointing summer in Australia. As a shrewd left-arm spinner who can make life difficult for batsmen and an useful batter in the middle-order , Jadeja was expected to play a key role for India in their bid to defend the trophy. However , the allrounder failed to come to the party despite being persisted with for all the games India played . James Anderson © Getty Bowling figures : 0/67 v AUS , 0/37 v NZ , 2/30 v SCO , 0/48 v SL , 2/45 v BAN , 1/18 v AFG . Average : 49.00. Economy : 5.32 He is the spearhead of the England pace attack. He is one of the best swing bowlers in the world. He is England 's highest wicket-taker in the five-day format. He is a world-class bowler. There 's no doubting this. However , when it comes to ODI cricket , especially World Cups , Anderson 's form takes a major dip and it was the case even in this tournament as the 32-year-old failed to inspire with the ball . Stuart Broad © Getty Bowling figures : 2/66 v AUS , 0/27 v NZ , 0/24 v SCO , 0/67 v SL , 1/52 v BAN , 1/18 v AFG . Average : 63.50. Economy : 5.36 . While he recovered in time for the World Cup after undergoing surgery on his right knee , Broad was not at his best and this reflected in his performance with the ball in the 2015 world event. He was expected to be James Anderson 's partner in crime and he did play that role , although in a negative way as his figures mirrored that of his pace-bowling colleague . Tinashe Panyangara © Getty Bowling figures : 1/73 v SA , 0/66 v UAE , 1/82 v WI , 0/49 v PAK , 1/69 v IRE , 2/53 v IND . Average : 78.40. Economy : 7.04 . All one can say about Zimbabwe 's opening bowler is that he had a dismal outing in the World Cup 2015 , coming under the attack several times. It was a tough learning experience for the 29-year-old , who will be hoping that the ordeal would help him improve as a cricketer . Bench : Thisara Perera , Umar Akmal , Ross Taylor , Kevin O'Brien © Getty Thisara Perera , with 62 runs at 20.66 and six wickets at an average of 46.66 and an economy of 6.74 , was a disappointment for Sri Lanka. Umar Akmal managed only 164 runs at 27.33 while Ross Taylor , despite getting 221 runs , was a big letdown. Ireland would have expected Kevin O'Brien to play a big role , but he too failed to come to the party . Coach : Peter Moores © Getty For one who favours data more than instincts , Moores will be the first to agree that England were a big disappointment . © Cricbuzz
