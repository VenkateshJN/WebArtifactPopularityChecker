Moin Khan sent home after casino visit Tue , Feb 24 2015 Last updated on Tuesday , 24 February , 2015 , 01 : 50 PM Moin Khan 's position as chief selector is also in danger. © Getty Pakistan chief selector Moin Khan has been sent home from the ICC World Cup after admitting that he visited a casino in Christchurch ahead of the team 's second Pool B game against West Indies on Saturday . " His return will not make a difference to the team 's performance as he was not part of the official World Cup squad , " Pakistan Cricket Board chief Shaharyar Khan said on Tuesday . " We probed the matter and Moin admitted he went to a casino in Christchurch but said he had gone there with friends to have dinner. We have told him he should return until we further probe the matter . " Manager Naved Cheema will now chair the tour selection committee with captain Misbah-ul-Haq and head coach Waqar Younis. " Pakistani fans are already up in arms over the PCB 's functioning following big defeats against arch-rivals India and West Indies , and the situation involving Moin is likely to bring more criticism and may eventually lead to his removal. After a huge hue and cry in Pakistan on the matter , the PCB decided to launch an investigation on Monday and Shaharyar had said : " We have launched an investigation over the reports that Moin Khan visited a casino , action will be taken if the reports prove true . " As per initial reports , Moin Khan went there to have a meal two days before the match against West Indies and a Pakistani couple photographed him and made a video . " But we will not make anybody a scapegoat and will investigate this incident before taking any action. " © Cricbuzz ( with inputs from agencies ) Tags
