Slump came at right time : Virat Kohli The author has posted comments on this article Hindol Basu , TNN | Oct 17 , 2014 , 11.28AM IST India 's Virat Kohli addresses the media ahead of the 4th ODI against West Indies in Dharamsala. ( PTI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 DHARAMSALA : During India 's tour of England , middle-order mainstay Virat Kohli was literally tortured by James Anderson who exposed the 25-year-old 's frailties against the swinging ball. Kohli had little idea about where his off-stump was and Anderson made him his bunny in both the ODIs and the preceding Test matches. His highest score ( 66 ) came in a one-off Twenty20 match , in which the English pacer did n't take part . A resolute Kohli , however , fought back in the Delhi ODI and scored a watchful 62 , raising hopes of return to form. The Delhi batsman now feels that he has found answers to his form-related problems. " As a cricketer , when you are in bad form , you discover several unknown facets about your game , your personality. One tends to work harder. During this period , I found out things I needed to improve upon in my game. At the international arena it 's all about feeling confident mentally , especially when you are not scoring runs. This ( slump in form ) came at the right time for me. Now , I feel I am mentally stronger. Runs will come and my cricket is going to improve from now onwards , " Kohli said , while interacting with the media . Expressing disappointment over the way he was targeted , he said , " I have scored consistently , won several matches for India in the last 4-5 years. I hope people keep that in mind while talking unnecessary stuff about me. " Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
