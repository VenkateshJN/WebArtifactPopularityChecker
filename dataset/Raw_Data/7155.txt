Chennai Super Kings v Delhi Daredevils , IPL 2015 , Chennai April 8 , 2015 New-look Daredevils land in deep end Start time 2000 local ( 1430 GMT ) Play 02 : 46 Agarkar : Chennai 's nucleus well set Big picture Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Daredevils are possibly IPL 's two most contrasting teams. One from the south , the other from north. One with an enviable IPL pedigree , the other with one of the poorest tournament records. One a stable team with a stable leader , the other , constantly looking for their messiah. One in yellow , almost as confident in IPL as Australia are in their gold kit , the other , in blue , a bit lost like England. It 's not difficult to see which team will be more nervous when the two meet in Chennai . After finishing at the bottom of the points table for two consecutive seasons , Daredevils went on a head-turning shopping binge at the IPL auction. Record cash was splashed on one man in the hope that it would rejuvenate a side devoid of an icon. It will be , therefore , a huge challenge for the team , as well as for Yuvraj Singh , to make a statement in their first outing , specially with the absence of Angelo Mathews , who wo n't be available to play as the match is in Chennai. A win would be perfect but even a good fight would ease Daredevils ' fans and management . However , that is not going to come easy. Super Kings , who made it to the play-offs last year without playing a game in Chennai , are going to love being back ; Chepauk is their fortress. It 's hard to imagine that the first two times Daredevils played here , they comfortably beat Super Kings. Daredevils , however , lost their last three games in Chennai. Can 2015 bring in the change ? Daredevils would certainly hope so . New outfit , same pressures on Yuvraj Singh © PTI Watch out for … Brendon McCullum has the habit of setting the tone as an opener. Last year , he was the third-highest run-getter for Super Kings with 405 runs. Those came at a strike rate of 121.62. But if his World Cup form - 328 runs at a scorching rate of 188.50 - is an indicator , McCullum could be one of the most dangerous batsman for Super Kings in the first half of the tournament . The same ca n't be said about Daredevils ' opener. Quinton de Kock had a brilliant start to his international career but had a poor World Cup , managing 145 runs in eight outings. There were others in the South Africa batting line-up to cover for his lack of form , but in the Daredevils set-up , he will have to lead the way . Stats and trivia Delhi Daredevils managed five wins in 30 matches over the last two seasons , a massive dip in fortunes after finishing at top of the table in the 2012 edition Zaheer Khan has n't played competitive cricket for almost a year - Mumbai Indians ' match against Kings XI on May 3 , 2014 was his last outing Quotes " Irfan Pathan is not fit and he will not be considered. Also , Andrew Tye is carrying a slight injury. These two players will have to be watched from day to day and my understanding is that they will not be available for selection for the first game. " Chennai Super Kings ' coach , Stephen Fleming " We have Yuvraj Singh this time. Shreyas Iyer is an exciting cricketer. In all counts , we want to do well in this IPL and hopefully we will be the first team to make the top four and then go up in the ladder.

OLDEST adi133 on April 9 , 2015 , 14 : 28 GMT 5 Indian international players in one team. Delhi 's main all-rounder not allowed to play. And then you say CSK is always a favorite on home turf. Such an unfair thing this. By the way there is no uncapped player in CSK XI. How can they do that. Are n't the officials aware of that or are they just ignoring because it 's CSK ? ? on April 9 , 2015 , 14 : 28 GMT I not only hope Delhi team wins this match against csk but also thrashes csk such that csk will develop nightmares remembering this match in the future but i really do not understand where is delhi team ? i hardly see any recognized players except few of them , this must be the weakest ipl team for sure. Even decock is not there too in the team it seems. So i really do not understand how delhi team can even dream of winning this one against csk , forget about inducing nightmares to csk , delhi can not even dream of winning this one , although i still hope somehow delhi can win this . Pindia on April 9 , 2015 , 14 : 20 GMT Why is n't Mattews playing ? CSK would never leave put McCullum or Dhoni and Mathews is of similar talent. Coulter-Nile and Albie Morkel are not in the same class neither is Duminy for that matter. Mathews or Yuvraj should have been made captain and played every game . on April 9 , 2015 , 13 : 50 GMT Hmmm I m also the regular fan of chennai but this time I will support daredevils because this is the team which will surprise everyone and may also top the tables.Their bowling attack looks formidable and if their batting line up shows their potential then it will be a cruiser for daredevils but words at one side and performance is the thing that matters.So go daredevils dare . on April 9 , 2015 , 13 : 11 GMT CSK often starts their campaign with a loss .......i remember in 2012 the lost against kkr ,...then in 2013 against mumbai ...and last year against punjab ...dnt knw about the rest years cskrocks777 on April 9 , 2015 , 13 : 05 GMT ca n't wait to watch the game CSK vs DD on April 9 , 2015 , 13 : 03 GMT My CSK XI : 1.Hussey 2.Brendon 3.Raina 4.Faf 5.Dhoni 6.Bravo 7.Jaddu 8.Ashwin 9.Ishwar Pandey 10.Ashish Nehra 11.

The problem with DD is that the owners were never serious about building a team right from the 1st season. Delhi players have done really well off late. How many have they tried to retain ? None. No cricketing logic can justify releasing Gambhir , Sehwag , Dhawan. Mishra and not bidding for Kohli , Ishant. They hire players when they are rookies and release them when they get mature and gain experience to perform. Warner , Maxwell , DeVillers , Dhawan , Gambhir...and they 'll follow it up with the current lot again...DeCock , Iyer etc. The DD owners see the franchise solely from the point of maximizing profits. They invested heavily in Yuvraj this season coz no sponsor wanted to be associated with them last season ! Yuvraj atleast will bring the sponsors in. It is Delhi 's misfortune that they own the city franchise . Hemu57 on April 9 , 2015 , 11 : 58 GMT Bow to fact that CSK is pretty settled and is a super natural team. But after all they are n't invincible , Especially for guys with extreme abilities like YUVI , ZAK , Thahir , Duminy. On the other hand mishra , de kock are potential players who can turn matches with mohmmed shami controlling mccullam . adi133 on April 9 , 2015 , 14 : 28 GMT 5 Indian international players in one team.

DilipanMA on April 9 , 2015 , 11 : 50 GMT It is important for players like YUVI , De kock and Dwyane Smith to show some form truecricketer3 on April 9 , 2015 , 11 : 10 GMT dd is looking like an unsettled line-up. Poor work done at auction. lets see Udendra on April 9 , 2015 , 10 : 31 GMT DD is nothing without Angelo Mathews . sweet2hrme on April 9 , 2015 , 10 : 20 GMT Yes ! CSK is very settled team , each player know their roles very well but for DD they have to settle at some point. So its a match between experience professional players vs non-experience players. Mathews is not playing DD will miss him badly . JBSA on April 9 , 2015 , 9 : 23 GMT Starting XI CSK : Smith , Baz , Raina , Faf , Bravo , Dhoni , Jadeja , Ashwin , Mohit , Nehra/Ishwar Pandey , Kuldeep/Rahul Sharma DD : Gautham/M Agarwal , De Kock , Shreyas Iyer , Yuvi , M Tiwary , JPD , K Jadhav/S Tiwary , Coulter-Nile , Mishra , Zaheer , Tahir on April 9 , 2015 , 9 : 21 GMT CSK looks solid as usual... But for Delhi.. Not sure of anything. I think indians will play crucial role in both teams.. Yuvi,Manoj,kedar,Mayank,Saurabh,Shami,Zaheer.Mishra.. etc Raina,Dhoni,Jaddu,Ashwin.. etc on April 9 , 2015 , 9 : 10 GMT Devils dare to jump into the fire , all confused and without a decent commander. And burn themselves. That had been their wont ! Year after year . For DD , would a new Phoenix emerge from the ashes of the past ? Would the diminutive Duminy pull out some new tricks ? Would the Indian Prince from Punjab , accept the new King ? Would they sack Zak from the playing XI , with a label of mentor ? Would the missionary zeal of a good Kirsten help the team 's resurrection ? Serious questions , to ponder ! But at Chennai , the Kings rule Super , despite an alligator in the moat around the fort owned by the emperor of the Kings got caught in the net. But nothing seems to affect the confidence of the Chennai King 's captain & his cavalcade ! They just march forward , into enemy territory , even without blowing their whistles. ( Whistle podu ? Not necessary ) on April 9 , 2015 , 9 : 03 GMT Best thing about CSK this year is that their bowling Unit as they are the only team who does not depend on their overseas bowlers but have a very well settled indian bowling unit Whistle podu chennai Shadeenctg on April 9 , 2015 , 8 : 25 GMT I think CSK is very hard working for IPL . CSK winning this day. B McCullum is fantastic player of the season. Thanks CSK Chennai Super Kings WIN Junaid Ansari on April 9 , 2015 , 8 : 13 GMT I hope these season yuvi fire , because when he fire , he took 's game another level. Still remember his six sixe 's srinideva on April 9 , 2015 , 8 : 10 GMT Champion team is always play like a champion...entertainment at its best when men in yellow enter the field. Best of luck...CSK.. # whistlepodu on April 9 , 2015 , 8 : 10 GMT Will be a hard one for Delhi against a settled team like Chennai. Yuvi needs to fire for Delhi, on April 9 , 2015 , 8 : 05 GMT The concern is about zaheer , shami etc bowling against csk - their loyalty towards dhoni or towards their team delhi will be something to be watched for , even yuvraj may have some loyalty towards dhoni. The reason for this possible loyalty is because dhoni is the captain of india and many of these players especially shami etc are still young and may find it difficult to bowl their best when dhoni is batting. Well i am not telling the conflict with loyalty by these players is a foregone conclusion , all i am telling there is some possibility of a conflict . cskrocks777 on April 9 , 2015 , 7 : 58 GMT Hopefully Chennai Super Kings rocks today with flourish Shridharan.S on April 9 , 2015 , 7 : 56 GMT Probable playind XI for CSK : 1.Smith 2.Baz 3.Raina 4.Faf 5.MSD ( wk ) ( c ) 6.Bravo 7.Jaddu 8.Ashwin 9.Mohit 10.Ishwar Pandey 11.Negi I think they need Abbott or Henry. But who do they replace with ? A solid Indian middle-order batsman is needed. Mithun Manhas can not fulfill this role. Ankush Bains can. In a way , Badrinath 's absence can be felt ! ! ! Game_Gazer on April 9 , 2015 , 7 : 29 GMT Angelo Mathews & fellow Srilankan cricketers are not officially welcome in Chennai by TN government & people , due to political/social tension , so Srilankan players wo n't participate in any IPL game played in Chennai on April 9 , 2015 , 7 : 24 GMT not to say much about yellow brigade as their stats of ipl speaks much better but coming to daredevils their bowling lineup is having much potential as compared to their past sides,spin twins of tahir and mishra ; depth bowling by coulter nile and new ball partners zaheer and shami shows the fire powers of their bowling side.in batting yuvi ,jp.and both tiwaris will be the core of delhis batting and surely they will be eagerly waiting to unleash the success in this ipl but to start the mission on winning note they have to pass one of the most formiddable teams of the ipl and too in their fortress ,go delhi daring without of much caring ( of defeats ) , Antony_Lucas on April 9 , 2015 , 7 : 14 GMT Cricinfo arent giving a playing XI because there is alot of guesswork with it being the first match. CSK could pick Abbott , Henry , or neither , most probably neither. Hard to go past CSK four internationals being McCullum , Smith , Du Plessis and Bravo. The recent form of Dwayne Smith wo n't mean much to messrs Fleming and Dhoni , Smith will be in DhoniManiac on April 9 , 2015 , 6 : 59 GMT The most disappointing part of this preview. " Irfan Pathan is not fit and he will not be considered. I was expecting alot from Irfan this season. Getting injured that too when a high profile tournament is about to begin. This is so bad. What a waste buy in the auction : / Pavinasen on April 9 , 2015 , 6 : 43 GMT My hopes are on DD , but you know they are playing CSK. The occurance will be as good as being struck 2 times by lightning if CSK loose . on April 9 , 2015 , 6 : 11 GMT Also @ INDIAN_KARI_PAKKU Chennai actually have 9 international players , same as Delhi . on April 9 , 2015 , 6 : 11 GMT DD in lack of hard hitting opener and finisher so no plce for them in playoffs... csk is consistant team still from begining my playing x1 1.mccullum 2.bains/hussey/smith 3.raina 4.faf 5.bravo 6.msd 7.jaddu 8.ashwin 9.mohit 10.kyle abbot/pandey 11.pathan Zafar_Abbas on April 9 , 2015 , 5 : 22 GMT can anyone help me on this , " absence of Angelo Mathews , who wo n't be available to play as the match is in Chennai " Indian_Kari_Pakku on April 9 , 2015 , 4 : 21 GMT " specially with the absence of Angelo Mathews , who wo n't be available to play as the match is in Chennai " . Why would a player not available if the match play in Chennai ? on April 9 , 2015 , 4 : 02 GMT The most important parts of the preview are missing. Where is the probable XI and the pitch report ? The preview seems worthless without those . on April 9 , 2015 , 3 : 40 GMT why @ CRICINFO is not giving probable playing XI . on April 9 , 2015 , 1 : 49 GMT Chennai is the favourite against any in team in IPL. That is known factor. So , we fans does n't worry about anything because we knew Chennai will be in final four. Delhi also combined with good players this time around but they ca n't post threatening score. I do n't think that Delhi will post 200 in any one of matches this season also. All teams are looking strong this season. So , DD has to work very hard to avoid the champion of table in other end. Good Luck . on April 9 , 2015 , 1 : 16 GMT Every season daredevils keep trying to build a new side. Mostly by spending a huge amount of money on a big name. And then they do n't even retain their best performers. They spent 10 crore on irfaan. Made no sense. An insane amount on Dinesh kartik and KP last year. None of them is in Delhi this year. I am pretty sure Yuvi wo n't be here next season Mr.CricketJKNotHussey on April 8 , 2015 , 21 : 50 GMT DD have a solid squad , well , they 've had one for the past few seasons but just screwed up with team selections and lost momentum at wrong times. They need to find a good team combination and stick to it , give the players some time to gel together and just beleive in the quality that they have. The XI should be : 1 ) De Kock , 2 ) Agarwal , 3 ) Tiwary , 4 ) Yuvi , 5 ) Duminy , 6 ) Jadhav , 7 ) Coulter-Nile , 8 ) Shami , 9 ) Mishra , 10 ) Khan , 11 ) Tahir. This gives them a good balance between Bowling and batting. De Kock can be dangerous on his day and Agarwal has played some nice knocks in the IPL before. Tiwary is a good batsman to stabalise at 3 or Yuvi/Duminy can come in early if the team is going well. The bowling looks solid with plenty of talent/experience. CSK is a hard side to beat but its not impossible . on April 8 , 2015 , 20 : 48 GMT Good luck Delhi Daredevils , Always a fan. Do your best . BRUTALANALYST on April 8 , 2015 , 20 : 47 GMT In regards to Smith last year 566 runs @ 35 with S/R of 133 was an outstanding performance throughout not sure how anyone could think about not including him in the final 11 BRUTALANALYST on April 8 , 2015 , 20 : 43 GMT Dwayne Smith has outperformed my favourite player McCullum the past 3 years in IPL but seems he does n't get given credit maybe it 's because he has not performed for WI and focussing on him may show IPl is not as strong as International game reading in previews many not even including him in a csk 11 which would be as stupid as Mumbai leaving out Simmons after last years performance . vkumar_086 on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 45 GMT Hi Devashish...very good comparison you made about CSK & DD as Australia & England respectively...now DD is revamped just like England team...hope the match wont be like the one sided first match ( Aus vs Eng ) of WC 2015...CSK are favourites here , but in a T20 game anything can happen...good luck to both teams indianzen on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 01 GMT It does n't matter if CSK win or loose. IPL is a game played around by all other teams with CSK in the final.. . Mukul Akolkar on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 24 GMT One thing I really hope for the Delhi Daredevils is that they should chase tomorrow. Chennai is one of the streongest and deepest batting sides in the IPL , and are fantastic chasers , having players like Raina , Dhoni , McCullum and Bravo. I do n't think DD can post a score too big to defend against the CSK lineup. On the other hand , Chennai 's bowling is really vulnerable , more so without Pathan. Ashwin is perhaps their only strike bowler tomorrow. So the likes of Duminy , Yuvraj , Iyer , etc can attack the bowlers and stay into the game till the end for Jadhav and Albie Morkel. The bigger worry though seems to be that of DeKock. He was in terrible form recently , and DD do n't have a genuine replacement for him at the top. DeKock 's form will be crucial for Delhi 's chances tomorrow . crrkiran on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 07 GMT csk will win this comfortably. ca n't see a side led by duminy beating a side led by dhoni. . adi133 on April 8 , 2015 , 17 : 08 GMT No doubt CSK will start as favourites but this Delhi side should not be underestimated. They 've a good combination this time. Although they 're going to miss Mathews tomorrow but still they have players to challenge any side .

BRUTALANALYST on April 8 , 2015 , 20 : 47 GMT In regards to Smith last year 566 runs @ 35 with S/R of 133 was an outstanding performance throughout not sure how anyone could think about not including him in the final 11 on April 8 , 2015 , 20 : 48 GMT Good luck Delhi Daredevils , Always a fan.
