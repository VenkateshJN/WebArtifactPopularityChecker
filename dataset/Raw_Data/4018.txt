Need to convert starts more often : Darren Bravo The author has posted comments on this article Gaurav Gupta , TNN | Oct 4 , 2014 , 11.30AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 MUMBAI : It 's a cross he will always have to bear. Whether he likes it or not , Darren Bravo will continue to be compared with a certain Brian Charles Lara . The gait , the batting style , the mannerisms...the similarities are just too much to ignore. During an interaction at the Cricket Club of India on Thursday , Bravo admitted it can be tough " at times " to deal with the constant comparison . " Whenever I step out to bat , everyone is expecting a lot. I can only go out there and try my best. Sometimes my best is going to be 100 , 10 or 5. The pressure is always there to perform. I just want to go out there and enjoy. It 's very important not to give up a fight and learn from my mistakes , " Bravo said . One of the mistakes he is making is getting out to R Ashwin repeatedly - the Indian off-spinner has taken his wicket five times in Tests. Ahead of a five-ODI , three-Test tour of India , Bravo needs to sort this out . " I know exactly where I went wrong. He is a very good bowler. At the same time I just need to continue backing myself. I have done well against him in previous games as well. I am not really worried about it. It is important that I get it right in this series. " Bravo 's bigger problem , however , is that for all the talent he has , this attractive lefthander should have had far more hundreds to show than just six in 32 Tests and two tons in 76 ODIs. Clearly , he has n't been able to convert starts well . " That is something that has been bothering me for quite some time. If I get starts , I give it away . That is something I need to get right and get it right as quickly as possible , " he stressed . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
