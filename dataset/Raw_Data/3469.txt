Chappell was a double-faced man , says Harbhajan The author has posted comments on this article Gaurav Gupta , TNN | Nov 4 , 2014 , 09.37AM IST Harbhajan Singh alleged that Greg Chappell caused rifts in the team by 'creating misunderstanding'. ( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 MUMBAI : Sachin Tendulkar 's revelation in his forthcoming autobiography is n't surprising considering the frosty relationship the Greg Chappell shared with the senior Team India players . Apart from Tendulkar , quite a few Indian players had hit out at Chappell 's dictatorial ways after the World Cup debacle in 2007. A prominent member of the team who had major issues with the former Australian captain was Harbhajan Singh . The off-spinner went through a tumultuous phase during Chappell 's time with the Indian team. On Tuesday , Harbhajan spared no punches while recalling the torrid time he and his teammates suffered during Chappell 's stint with Team India from 2005-07 . The 34-year-old off-spinner , who took 413 Test wickets , alleged that Chappell caused rifts in the team by 'creating misunderstanding' . " He had spoiled the atmosphere , implement a 'divide and rule policy'. He would instigate fights between us so that he would be able to do what he wanted. He would trigger misunderstanding between us by telling us 'this player was saying this against you ' , when in fact , that player would n't have said anything , " Harbhajan told TOI . Harbhajan felt Chappell lost the confidence of the players also because of the fact that he would betray them in the media. " He hated it if we asked him questions. He would say something to us , and then say something entirely different to the media. He was a double-faced man. What Sachin has written about him is absolutely true .
