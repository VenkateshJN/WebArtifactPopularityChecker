Maxwell , Faulkner lift Australia to 278/8 against England The author has posted comments on this article Reuters | Feb 1 , 2015 , 12.49PM IST Australian batsman Glenn Maxwell drives to the boundary during the tri-series final against England at the WACA in Perth. ( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 Glenn Maxwell missed his maiden one-day international century but his career-best 95 helped Australia overcome a wobbly start and post 278 for eight against England in the final of the tri-series in Perth on Sunday . Put into bat , Australia were reeling at 60 for four in the 18th over but Maxwell found an able ally in Mitchell Marsh ( 60 ) and the duo added 141 runs in 23.2 overs to rebuild the innings . Down the order , James Faulkner blasted an unbeaten 24-ball 50 to give Australian bowlers a strong total to defend . The hosts lost opener Aaron Finch even before they could open their account and David Warner became James Anderson 's second victim in the seventh over . In-form Steve Smith , however , batted confidently until off-spinner Moeen Ali exhibited his newly-developed habit of claiming crucial breakthroughs . Smith returned having contributed 40 of Australia 's 60 runs at that stage but the Maxwell-Marsh partnership allayed the fears of a batting capitulation with some aggressive cricket . Maxwell displayed his wide array of shots - both conventional and cheeky -- in his belligerent knock , bringing up his ninth fifty with a reverse paddle that raced to the boundary . The right-hander hit four boundaries in a Chris Woakes over before falling to Stuart Broad in the next , while Marsh was run out soon after , paying the price for a late decision to go for a second run . After their departure , Faulkner provided the late assault , smashing four sixes -- including three in the same Woakes over and the other in the final delivery to bring up his fifty .
