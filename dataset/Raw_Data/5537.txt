The Indian team had arrived in Perth on Monday after beating South Africa in their second league match in Melbourne the previous day . Although the statement released by the BCCI did n't mention the date of his return , Fletcher is expected to return to Perth where India are scheduled to play two matches - the first against United Arab Emirates on Saturday and the next against the West Indies on March 6 . The Indian team conducted a short yet intense training session at the WACA ground on Wednesday where they practiced several fielding drills but had a day of rest on Thursday , where they had taken time off to visit the beaches of Perth and engaged in a spot of beach cricket . Earlier on Thursday , fast bowler Mohammed Shami had visited a local hospital along with team physio Nitin Patel even though the cause for his visit is not known. Shami had taken part in the team 's training session the previous day and had taken up his usual position as goalkeeper during the team 's beloved football session after conducting fielding drills . India will play UAE , who lost to Ireland in Brisbane on Wednesday and are still searching for their first victory in World Cups. MS Dhoni 's team , on the other hand , is unbeaten after winning both their Pool B fixtures against Pakistan and South Africa . The Indian team will remain in Perth until their second game at the WACA against West Indies . © Cricbuzz Tags
