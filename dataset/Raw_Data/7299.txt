OLDEST fanofcricket123 on March 23 , 2015 , 20 : 31 GMT Sportstar magazine. 1988/89ish. Chennai. A big poster of a West Indian fast bowler. The sentence read thus : The name as long as the man himself - Elcon Lindwall Curtly Ambrose. That sentence has somehow stuck in my memory for so long. His name has only gotten bigger with the knighthood. It is unfortunate that a man who did n't talk much but just played has to do all the talking to his bowlers these days who do n't play much . My favorite Ambrose moments : 7 wickets for 1 run in a Test match , Mark Waugh 's dismissal in 1996 WC semifinal and of course the skirmish with Steve Waugh while Richie Richardson was pulling him back. Until this day , Steve could still not fathom how stupid he was to rile Curtly that day in 1994/95 . West Indies lost their batsmen first , then their bowlers and their passion. They 've finally lost their cricket and the game has lost its soul. How sad . on March 22 , 2015 , 6 : 11 GMT As a young boy growing up I always like looking at Sir Courtney Ambrose he bowl really and with good control I alway thought that he was a serious person but it was last year I get to see the funny side of him at cpl 2014 when he was working with Guyana Amazon warrior he is really a nice human being on March 20 , 2015 , 20 : 21 GMT Ambrose is the best .. I clearly remember that turtle dove celebrations.Treat to watch .My all time favorite bowler . johnthekiwi on March 20 , 2015 , 18 : 23 GMT I 'm not overly happy to be 45 but I am happy to say I saw both of those guys live or in real time when each was at their best. Both of them have big egos but when you can do it on the field it is n't arrogance. I really miss the 80 's thru mid 90 's version of the game and the players. Can still remember the sound of Akram hitting Cairns in the head coming through the radio I had at school. Not a particularly great memory but what Chatfield and Coney achieved after that ( especially Chatfield when you consider his past ) is a fond memory . voyager on March 20 , 2015 , 15 : 48 GMT Ask him about his debut series against Pakistan 1988. When they bowled 70 no balls in an innings just to bowl nasty bouncers to Miandad , if he was part of that as well or not . KingOwl on March 20 , 2015 , 1 : 46 GMT " They would come to myself and the other quicks and make a complaint. Ask us to sort them out. " And often that would only end one way. Wow , that is awesome ! I am glad he does not believe in sledging. Those who have true talent do n't need sledging . on March 20 , 2015 , 1 : 36 GMT West Indies will win all remaining games. Let 's go Windies let 's go . on March 20 , 2015 , 0 : 08 GMT West Indies will never get a fast bowler like ambrose and Walsh in the bowling department the guys Dem is not serious and west Indies will never get no openner like grenage an Haynes Quarterchickenandchips on March 19 , 2015 , 22 : 14 GMT One of the greatest bowlers of all time. However , a big head none the less. Always thought he was better than everyone else , not just cricket wise. Like most West Indians at the time. The statement to be asked to " sort them out " speaks volumes about how big his head was.But they got the results at the time so they could get away with feeling superior to everyone else. And by the way good on dean jones for asking him to remove his wristbands. If it bothered him while he was batting then he had every right to ask. Would have hurt curtlys ego but. Good on dean jones . kriketluva on March 19 , 2015 , 21 : 23 GMT Just love Ambrose. He 's spot on about the sledging. Just shows you are not good enough when you have to resort to underhanded tactics to win. Have no respect for any sledgers. Agree with Gavaskar and Lloyd about them. Just plain bullying and no respect for anyone. They should turn up the stump mikes and have them all wear microphones whilst on the field. And the one 's who do it then run to the umpires when they are given a dose of their own medicine. He 's crossed the line they say. Rubbish. They should just cut it out and play . fanofcricket123 on March 23 , 2015 , 20 : 31 GMT Sportstar magazine. 1988/89ish. Chennai. A big poster of a West Indian fast bowler.

I have huge respect for McGrath or Donald as great bowlers , but it never quite is the same when they decide to mouth off . on March 19 , 2015 , 18 : 38 GMT Hadlee too shares the same views about sledging as Curtly does. When you are as good with your skill as these two were in their time , a motormouth is the last thing you need to be . K_Doc on March 19 , 2015 , 13 : 05 GMT These are legends of cricket. Guys like Amberose and Andy Roberts , they never smile. Today , batsmen and bowlers are all huggy huggy ; even to the opposition . whitebull3 on March 19 , 2015 , 8 : 29 GMT Those were the fast bowling Giants , the men from back in the day , i remember when Greatbatch played those incredible shots in that match it felt a little strange because it hadn ` t been done before then .
