" Indications are he will contest ( for the president-ship of BCCI ) . He 's expected to decide on February 27 whether he will contest and attend the BCCI AGM , " the sources said . This time it 's the turn of East Zone affiliates of the BCCI to propose and second the name of the president . MCA sources said Pawar was confident of getting the requisite support from the East Zone as well as the rest of the Board if it comes to a contest with the ruling faction . Significantly , the MCA 's managing committee is scheduled to meet here on Friday , but Pawar is unlikely to preside over it , sources said . The NCP chief , who headed the Board from 2005-08 , is considered as one of the alternatives to take over BCCI 's reins from the faction which is close to Board 's president-in-exile N Srinivasan . As per a recent Supreme Court ruling over a petition citing his conflict of interest within the BCCI , Srinivasan can not contest the election unless he disassociates from his Indian Premier League franchise Chennai Super Kings . The apex court had said that the conflict of interest has arisen between what is Srinivasan 's duty as BCCI President and his interest as the father-in-law of Gurunath Meiyappan and the owner of Chennai Super Kings .
