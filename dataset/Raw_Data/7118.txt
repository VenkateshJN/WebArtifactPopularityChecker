No local quality fast bowler....... Once agian fully dependent on Slinga Malinga....... . CricketMaan on February 16 , 2015 , 11 : 31 GMT Me think Sanga 's deal with Surrery means he is not available for entire IPL , therefore no bids ? Pindia on February 16 , 2015 , 11 : 27 GMT Mathews to Delhi could be the purchase of this season. Delhi look good , with Mishra and Yuvaj meaning their Indian boys wo n't have any weak links. Not sure about Sunrisers- Boult and Williamson should go well , but does losing Finch balance by bringing in Pietersen and Morgan ; and still think they should have stuck with Mishra... Think all of the teams now looks pretty strong . on February 16 , 2015 , 11 : 26 GMT willaimson 60 lacs , hashim amla goes unsold... but cariappa gets 2.5 crores.. whats going on in this auction ? ? ? ?

Hussey3323 on February 16 , 2015 , 10 : 55 GMT Kings X11 Should Go with Indian Fast Bowler with Zak kavadikiran on February 16 , 2015 , 10 : 50 GMT Munaf , zaheer , RP , Mithun , Aravind , Sharath , sudeep ( Inidan Seamers ) franchises can look into.. 2nd chance on February 16 , 2015 , 10 : 48 GMT Rcb should have kept yuvraj. dk is not a good enough replacement . Abbott and milne are good buys. Exciting pace attack of aaron , starc , milne and abbott. Hope sammy is the all rounder we lacked last year. Badri is a bargain buy kdboy on February 16 , 2015 , 10 : 46 GMT Irfan , good addition to CSK 's strength to address their bowling woes binu.emiliya on February 16 , 2015 , 10 : 43 GMT MI should go for Rahul Shukla and Ashok meneria,not local batting talents fro MI this year also Depes on February 16 , 2015 , 10 : 39 GMT No Alma ? The Bowlers Will be Probably Happy on February 16 , 2015 , 10 : 37 GMT Nice to see Pathan In CSK.... . ashugaurav13 on February 16 , 2015 , 10 : 29 GMT c'mon MI...go for Irfan...you need a player like him.. . on February 16 , 2015 , 10 : 28 GMT Thank God they didnt take Sanga and Amla ! ! No place for old legs in the world 's biggest crcketing franchise ! on February 16 , 2015 , 10 : 15 GMT Im really surprised that 'His Majesty Amla went ú nsold ! The ipl brings with it so many surprises . crrkiran on February 16 , 2015 , 10 : 09 GMT auction at the wrong time. just when everyone are cheering India for the world cup , this auction brings the regionalism and club issues. forget this ipl at least till world cup is over . mysay on February 16 , 2015 , 10 : 05 GMT The highest buy for a " Has Been " when players in the rank of Ronchi , Maxwell , Corey Anderson , Mr. " Big " Brendon Mc Cullum , Amla , Miller being available. Well anyway such buys are why DD are yet to win it . gundlupet12 on February 16 , 2015 , 10 : 04 GMT i like rajasthan royals so all the best on February 16 , 2015 , 10 : 03 GMT Cant believe way auction is going on...battle-tested veterans who can change matches single-handed being unsold and young inexperienced chaps being picked up at jaw-dropping prices...only that they have to be Indians...Wonder who 's fertile brains are working behind the bids...utterly shocked ! on February 16 , 2015 , 9 : 56 GMT Surprised that no one wants Balaji.. Thalai - Retirement time and Tamil Commentary on Star Vijay beckons ! Shridharan.S on February 16 , 2015 , 9 : 55 GMT Well , this auction has seen some of the smart buys from franchises. CSK need a good Indian middle-order batsman to shore up their squad. They have four overseas players in Smith,Baz,Faf and Bravo. But they sometimes tend to drop Faf in favour of an overseas bowler. In this scenario , they used to play Manhas in the middle-order. But he did n't prove to be effective. So,an Indian middle-order batsman is required. Dinesh Karthik would have been ideal as he can even double up as wicket-keeper. They have a good buy in Kyle Abbott. He is highly rated in bowling at the death. Subramaniam Badrinath too could have been bought with a base price of Rs.30 lakhs. Trent Boult for Rs.70 lakhs is a very good buy . on February 16 , 2015 , 9 : 53 GMT RCB more than made up for its lack of match winning bowlers in the last auction. Aaron , Abbott , Milne and Starc generate some serious pace. Would be interesting to see if they only use one overseas full time bowler to accommodate for Sammy or if they use two overseas bowlers and Jalaj Saxena as the allrounder . Bangla_Tigers_Shamim on February 16 , 2015 , 9 : 49 GMT DD have a great coach Gary Kirsten and Yuvi his most powerful & capable soldier. so do n't comments like this . on February 16 , 2015 , 9 : 46 GMT KKR are basically buying back ups and the core of their setup remains the same. Neesham will be a good replacement keeping the long term future in mind. At this point all KKR need is backup keeper for Uthappa and we shall be good . Even now , if KKR does not buy any more players , we are still in very good shape to put up a strong showing on February 16 , 2015 , 9 : 46 GMT KC CARIAPPA 19 yr old will do the magic For KKR on February 16 , 2015 , 9 : 44 GMT KKR has a CEO who is from Karnataka and he has done good research on local talent. Thats why they have gone for players like Cariappa. THere are many more good players from KPL. There is a guy " Rajeev " who plays for CCL and played KPL too. He hits huge sixes like Gayle and recently he scored 32 balls century on the same day when ABD scored 31 balls Century. Why dont RCB do research on local players : ( immortalsidu on February 16 , 2015 , 9 : 41 GMT just ridiculous..so many fans so happy about the auctions..encouraging this meaningless t20 crap...the very same fans will be here cribbing about their teams ( India ) shambolic performance in tests when they get beaten black and blue by heavyweights rulesofthegame on February 16 , 2015 , 9 : 35 GMT Just confirms how inversely proportional a player 's talent is to his selling price in the IPL. And to wapuser , Ronchi is not a " young " foreign player , he has proven himself in overseas conditions many times. But then again , when was the IPL about performance ? soumyadutnag on February 16 , 2015 , 9 : 25 GMT KKR has done smart business. Having released only Jacques Kallis and Manvinder Bisla among known names , James Neesham and Brad Hogg ( back up for Narine ) are more than decent buys. The icing on the cake would be Irfan Pathan at ~ 2/3 crores ningthoujam on February 16 , 2015 , 9 : 21 GMT DD repeats the same mistake of buying ageing superstars for big money , past the prime. Last year it was KP and now Yuvi . on February 16 , 2015 , 9 : 20 GMT Advantage of having buisiness men at such Auctions , they not only know how to improve the team 's assets but also how to screw the opposition......... Well played Vijay Malya you proved your true worth as a buisiness man by forcing Delhi to buy Yuvi at a hilariously exorbitant amount ! ! ! ! Tarun_Lohiya on February 16 , 2015 , 9 : 12 GMT Hi guys , I know Dominic personally. He is a committed player and always ready to give his best. We have played together at the AFK ground in Pune. All the best dear Dominic . GRJVPR on February 16 , 2015 , 9 : 09 GMT George Bailey 's form is a concern ! KXIP should go for a backup.. May be Jayawardene martinmoha on February 16 , 2015 , 9 : 01 GMT Big Big surprise why HASHIM AMLA not sold ? Though he is best for one-day and test but he is technically so sound that wreck any bowling attack on flat pitches . Blue_eagel on February 16 , 2015 , 8 : 28 GMT CSK 's line up so far Mr.cricket , Mcullam,Raina,Faf,bravo,dhoni,jadeja,.........,Ashwin/R.Sharma,M.sharma,Nehra , they need to fill the blank with a seaming all rounder from india. Thats all , auction over for CSK . Crickarimnagar on February 16 , 2015 , 8 : 17 GMT You feel good about IPL when Shreyas Iyer gets a higher bid than Kane Williamson on February 16 , 2015 , 8 : 13 GMT Do n't get the logic...ipl is played in India ...some of these young foreign playes will just struggle...Luke ronchi fans ..do n't think he will survive in these conditions on February 16 , 2015 , 8 : 13 GMT well I see that some IPL teams are signing up kids. You wont win anything with kids. Also not signing Ross Taylor ? yet has been Peiterson gets a good packet.LOL on February 16 , 2015 , 8 : 08 GMT SRH definitely need some good indian/domestic players in the team as it will bring good balance to team when your star players failed. Team looks good with Morgan and Warner..But still , need atleast one more massive striker of the ball like Gayle,Maxwell , Miller , ABD . cheeku75 on February 16 , 2015 , 8 : 07 GMT Can we have the team list please , just to see how they stack up ! dak.w on February 16 , 2015 , 7 : 57 GMT RR , CSK n KKR r just atendees in this auction. CSK bought Kyle Abbott n RR bought Morris which is a gud deal.. Money on Yuvi n Kartik is a waste.. Still waiting for Mitch Marsh. I guess he is unavailable.. Sanga n Amla r unsold. . on February 16 , 2015 , 7 : 53 GMT Looks like the time for allrounders : - ) Rahulthevirufan on February 16 , 2015 , 7 : 47 GMT I think dd have erred on iyer they need to buy a wk n 2 quicks sam6e on February 16 , 2015 , 7 : 47 GMT Dhawan,Rahul,Warner,KP,Ojha,Morgan,Rasool,Karansharma,Steyn,Bhuvi,Praveenkumar...does n't look a team worth winning IPL but competitive for sure sam6e on February 16 , 2015 , 7 : 39 GMT SRH should have gone more for local batters like Vijay,Badri,dinesh karthik etc. , they have only Dhawan,Rahul and Naman Ojha...surely a couple of more additions would have made wonders to their teams...overseas is ok with Warner,KP,Morgan,Bopara , Steyn,Boult etc and local bowlers are good too Bhuvi,PK.. . Lestat70 on February 16 , 2015 , 7 : 36 GMT Everytime Yuvraj Singh sold out with big money and everytime he used to disappont his team owner . on February 16 , 2015 , 7 : 32 GMT No matter how many great foreign bowlers RCB take , Gayle and ABD will be constant , so now they have a stockpile of good fast bowlers to choose from , still feel they need a good Indian all rounder to have to foreign quickies Rahulthevirufan on February 16 , 2015 , 7 : 32 GMT no mitch marsh in auction ? ? ? ? ? is he not part of it and u guys wrote on ur blog last set of capped players Rahulthevirufan on February 16 , 2015 , 7 : 31 GMT @ James elphick they have done it. they sent 700 playes list to teams who pruned it down to 300 something. teams keep their options alive and hence send lot of players name back and these are the backup guys who remain unsold on February 16 , 2015 , 7 : 24 GMT KKR has to get a back-up wicket-keeper batsman ....Only Uttappa is there now on February 16 , 2015 , 7 : 22 GMT Where is Michel Marsh ? : P Rahulthevirufan on February 16 , 2015 , 7 : 20 GMT dd middle order reads yuvi jp mathews 3 guys who can make into any side as batsman alone n provide very good bowling options this will add mighty depth to both their battin n bowling. they however do need a bowling spearheaded until shami or nile are up for it and definitely a loacl wk bat Pradeep Gowda on February 16 , 2015 , 7 : 19 GMT kayle Abbot for 30 lakhs is cheap buy for csk. he is very good death bowler who can bowls very good yarkers too. wise for 2.8 crore really bad buy by rcb SaurabhBh12 on February 16 , 2015 , 7 : 18 GMT Can anyone provide what are the Teams so far. . on February 16 , 2015 , 7 : 17 GMT Would n't this auction be faster and less terrible if they gave each team the full list of entrants and only put up for auction those players that they have an interest in. In fact , to make it even more streamlined , they could list their opening bid for each player , and the highest one would be the starting point for each of them at auction. I mean , this current system is just perverse . Pradeep Gowda on February 16 , 2015 , 7 : 17 GMT Since kallis not playing. then kkr could have bought sanga r amla.

They need domestic batters. Delhi have everything , now they need a good opener at the top. Do n't see anyone like that available , unless they make get someone like Amla or Jayawardena and make him open. Finch was good , but he went out of their hands.

Punjab have too many top order batsmen . zig1 on February 16 , 2015 , 6 : 36 GMT What were RCB thinking shelling out so much for Dinesh Karthik when they could have retained Parthiv Patel for a lesser price and could have bought Murali Vijay and Mike Hussey ! ! on February 16 , 2015 , 6 : 35 GMT RCB 's batting may have faltered last tym ; But arguably they have the best batting line up in IPL.They just need good quickies on February 16 , 2015 , 6 : 32 GMT @ kaustubh : MI hav wrapped finch for opening slot Rahulthevirufan on February 16 , 2015 , 6 : 27 GMT yes srh seems to put too much in their bowlers steyn boult ishant pk bhuvi when not one of them is a good allrounder makes more sense to buy a spinner or an indian batsman coz u can only play 4 overseas and right now except for dhawan dey do n't have one and if they play all intl batters then money on steyn n boult gets waste. they repeating last year mistakes on February 16 , 2015 , 6 : 27 GMT Boult is a backup for Steyn.. if steyn gets injured they will replace him with boult SRH bharathmsd7 on February 16 , 2015 , 6 : 25 GMT csk moreover balanced..they should look for fast bowlers . Varunsahu on February 16 , 2015 , 6 : 24 GMT I think Mumbai Indians should go for Irfan Pathan. They do n't have any decent Indian bowler. Irfan is an All rounder and he will provide a good option . on February 16 , 2015 , 6 : 24 GMT Rcb Should only focus to get Few more indian quickies as dinda and aaron have look out of sorts in most of the games on February 16 , 2015 , 6 : 23 GMT @ siddhant 'sms ' shah : DD has South African Q De Cock as a WK . gopal.aga on February 16 , 2015 , 6 : 22 GMT @ Kaustubh , What is Aaron Finch if not an opening batsman ? 1988_1988 on February 16 , 2015 , 6 : 21 GMT Think thats the reason you are not in the auction vaibhav_mehrotra on February 16 , 2015 , 6 : 21 GMT Mumbai needs a good fast bowler , last year Malinga was extra burdened to perform in every match .
