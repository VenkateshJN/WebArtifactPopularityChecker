Besides , when a replacement comes so late in the tournament , the chance of that player getting a looking remains suspect when the team is winning . But Stephen Fleming made it clear on Saturday that the younger Hussey is an important man in their scheme of things . " He will fit in the middle order. We will look at Faf ( du Plessis ) , he has got some experience opening the batting. So one of the options we have is to move Faf up the order and keep Dave in the middle where he is more accustomed to , " the CSK coach said on Saturday . " We have got a couple of games , we will juggle the players depending on their fitness. Faf was a little bit gingerly if you remember the last game , somehow we managed it through.

Fleming showered praise on the Australian , saying his addition allows Chennai to retain the strength of their middle-order . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Stephen Fleming,Mahendra Singh Dhoni,Faf du Plessis,David Hussey,Chennai Super Kings Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
