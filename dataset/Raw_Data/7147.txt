It will be utter bore & useless if teams play with the regular members , teams should give more chances to young talents consistently. After seeing the squads , so many players are waiting to play , so do n't think these 5 players will get chance and prove their ability. Other countries , especially Australia , are eagerly participating in this IPL , its because of 2016 T20 World Cup to be played in India. So BCCI should focus on creating new talents , I do n't think the current Indian Team will lift T20 WC next year. Need to find out a proper all-rounder at No. 7. Ravindra Jadeja has running out of time..... . on April 7 , 2015 , 9 : 00 GMT When are we going to see a young fast bowler coming. We need raw /pacey /naturally aggressive out in out fast bowlers.
