It happened while Dhoni was facing a net bowler whose delivery kicked up suddenly and brushed his forearm . Dhoni was seen applying ice-pack but team 's media manager Dr RN Baba , who told PTI , " Dhoni is fine and there is no problem with him. " Considering that Baba said the same thing about Mohammed Shami 's injury a day earlier , one would need to wait till Dhoni walks out for the toss . Meanwhile , administrative manager Arshad Ayub will be heading back to India to attend the BCCI Annual General Meeting in Chennai on March 2 . Ayub is the president of Hyderabad Cricket Association ( HCA ) and an important member of the president in-exile N Srinivasan 's faction . He will be back in Australia before India 's match against the West Indies , scheduled on March 6 . © PTI Tags
