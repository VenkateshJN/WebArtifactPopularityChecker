Several members of the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) were reportedly angry with the West Indian players for abandoning the Indian tour due to their pay dispute with their players association. They wanted the BCCI to teach the players a lesson by banning them for at least one season of the cash-rich tournament . However several other members felt that the players were not at fault for the decision to withdraw from the tour and hence could n't be punished. The governing council , which met today , has finally taken a stand , allowing the West Indian players to continue playing for their respective franchises . " West Indies players will be playing in IPL , " said the T20 league 's chairman Ranjib Biswal , after the Working Committee meeting . However , BCCI joint secretary and Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association president , Anurag Thakur , said that a formal announcement regarding the West Indies players ' IPL participation will be made later . Meanwhile the Twenty20 tournament is scheduled to kickstart on April 9 , 2015 just after the ODI World Cup in Australia and New Zealand . " IPL-8 will begin from April 9 next year and the franchises will get 11 days for preparation of the T20 league after the end of the World Cup , " a member of the IPL Governing Council told PTI .
