Superman AB almost missed Windies game Sat , Feb 28 2015 Last updated on Saturday , 28 February , 2015 , 02 : 36 AM © Getty As AB de Villiers went berserk against the hapless West Indians on Friday , social media was abuzz with suggestions that he should be barred from playing against humans . While that may not be plausible , it 's interesting to note that the South African captain almost missed this game after spending a sleepless night battling with a stomach upset . " When we boarded the bus , he was fifty-fifty to play the game. He was vomiting , he had diarrhea and had no energy to even stand , forget about playing and then he walks and plays that kind of an innings. There 's hardly anything this man ca n't do on the cricket field , " South African Performance Analyst Prasanna Agoram told TOI from Sydney , where AB struck a 66-ball 162 , the second fastest hundred in the World Cup . There 's something even more fascinating about the 31-year-old though. While almost every batsman turns to technology to fine tune and hone his game , AB does n't even watch his own video dismissals. " Whatever technical corrections he wants to make , he does them all by himself , sometimes even during the game.Over the last five years , he is the one South African player , who has seen his batting less than anyone else. The likes of Dale Steyn , Hashim Amla , Morne Morkel , Imran Tahir and the others watch their videos the very same day. David Miller watches right after he comes out of the ground.But this man whether he scores a 100 or a duck , he hardly bothers to see if he has done any wrong , " Agoram , who has also worked with the likes of Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma , Ravindra Jadeja and others during their junior days , said . © TNN
