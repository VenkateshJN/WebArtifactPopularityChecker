2 0 7.1 to BB McCullum , and he gets the big wicket first ball , that was a very good catch by Kula behind square on leg. Baz mistimed the pull and got a leading edge which went pretty high on the leg side , Kula ran to his left quite a bit from short fine leg and dived in the end to catch it with both hands 40/1 26.5 to Latham , third man was too tempting , blinded Latham to the lack of width on this ball and Mathews strikes with the change of pace. The inside edge of the angle blade is taken off the shortish delivery and deflects onto the stumps 139/2 28.5 to Taylor , two in two overs for Mathews ! But Taylor 's reviewed it straight away. He had moved across to a good length ball on middle and leg , quite a long way actually , and has been rapped in front of middle. On the knee-roll. HotSpot shows no edge either. Looks like New Zealand are headed towards a lost review. And yep , the ball tracker said it would clip leg stump and sides with umpire 's call 145/3
