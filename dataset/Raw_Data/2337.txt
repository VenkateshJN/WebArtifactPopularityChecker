Playoffs hope floats for Sunrisers Hyderabad Sourav ModakSourav Modak,TNN | May 23 , 2014 , 10.13 AM IST Warner took the battle to the CSK attack , treating all bowlers with contempt. ( PTI Photo ) RELATED RANCHI : David Warner ( 90 , 45b , 12x4 , 3x6 ) played a blinder and Shikhar Dhawan supported him nicely ( 64 no , 45b , 4x4 , 2x6 ) as Sunrisers Hyderabad stunned Chennai Super Kings by six wickets in their IPL match on Thursday . With this win , SRH , now fifth in the table , kept alive their slim hopes of qualifying for the playoffs . With a stiff target of 186 looming large , Warner took the battle to the CSK attack , treating all bowlers with contempt . However , just when a century was looking inevitable , the Australian was dismissed , bowled by countrymate John Hastings. SRH suffered a few hiccups after his dismissal but managed to get to the target in the final over . Earlier , MS Dhoni clobbered Dale Steyn for 24 runs in the final over of the CSK innings to take his team to 185 for three. He hit the South African ace for two fours and two huge sixes . The late firework by the CSK skipper overshadowed David Hussey 's fantastic knock of 50 off 33 balls at the JSCA stadium. Opener Dwayne Smith had given initial fillip to the innings with a quickfire 47 off 28 balls with four fours and four sixes . CSK got off to a flying start thanks to their new opening pair of Smith and Faf du Plessis , who collected 24 runs from the first two overs . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Sunrisers Hyderabad,Shikhar Dhawan,MS Dhoni,David Warner,Chennai Super Kings Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
