Roger Federer has no imminent plans to join India 's World Cup supporters Â© Getty Images Enlarge Roger Federer has issued a public apology - does n't everyone these days ? - after ill-advisedly agreeing to a Facebook marketing stunt showing him drooling over India 's World Cup shirt . Federer 's display of loyalty was to his sponsor , Nike , rather than any affinity with the Indian cricket team , but his comment " Dressing up for a gentleman 's game today # BleedBlue " brought such a hostile reaction from some fans that as a non-cricket lover he could never have imagined . Federer , a 17-times Grand Slam winner , explained : " It was more of a Nike thing to be quite honest. I met some of the Indian players and I had just spent some time in India so they presented the shirt to me. I support South Africa , and everybody knows that. The idea was n't to spark any fire and I 'm sorry if it did that. " Federer 's mother Lynette is from South Africa and the Roger Federer Foundation has raised money for disadvantaged South African children . One Pakistan supporter , a student at Cambridge University , told Pakistan 's Express Tribune that he had deleted all his photos of Federer and also claimed to have taken a rudimentary opinion poll " in which ten out of 12 Pakistanis felt hurt or betrayed " . Federer 's commitment to cricket sounds distinctly hit and miss. " It really depends where you are , " he said. " When I 'm in America definitely not. When I 'm in Europe definitely not. But then when I 'm in Australia and here in the UAE a little bit sometimes. " Even now , cricket fans in the United States and England ( which Federer might have briefly forgotten is in Europe ) are preparing to be offended . RELATED LINKS
