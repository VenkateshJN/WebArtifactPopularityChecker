World Cup 2015 : Shakib hopeful of stunning India The author has posted comments on this article Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 MELBOURNE : Sri Lanka coach Chandika Hathurusingha had admitted the other day that in their preparation for the World Cup , the Bangladesh team , among other things , had also sought help of a psychologist . It was , Hathurusingha added , one of the ways to get ready for a big tournament where Bangladesh would be up against some of the top teams. On Tuesday , when all-rounder Shakib-Al Hasan was asked how the team had benefited from the psychologist , his answer suggested how tough a session with those shrinks can get . " It 's hard to describe how he ( a psychologist ) works on the team unless you have met a psychologist. It 's very hard to share what they say and what their view is. If you take that view it 's a different life , " he said . A different life it is for Bangladesh in this World Cup , making it to the quarterfinals of a World Cup for the very first time. And from here , armed with a winning mindset , they 'll take on defending champions India. Shakib says his team will give it all . " You can say it 's the biggest game of our careers , because this is the first time we 're playing in a World Cup quarterfinal. It 's a one-off game and if we have a good day , they ( India ) have a bad day. You never know , " he said. Shakib does n't give much thought to that now 'famous ' Virender Sehwag comment about Bangladesh being an ordinary side. " I do n't think in a World Cup , any team takes the other lightly. We 're doing well and our confidence is high , " he says . Dhoni 's return to form and the top-order performing in turns will keep Bangladesh on their toes going into the big match , but Shakib says his team will give it everything on the day it matters .
