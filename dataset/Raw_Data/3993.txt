MS Dhoni backs ICC crackdown on chuckers The author has posted comments on this article Prasanth Menon , TNN | Oct 8 , 2014 , 11.44AM IST Dhoni backed ICC 's decision to take a hard line on suspect actions. ( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 KOCHI : The ICC 's recent crackdown on bowlers with suspect actions has triggered a hornet 's nest after several high-profile bowlers - including Pak off-spinner Saeed Ajmal and West Indies ' Sunil Narine -were reported for chucking . India , though , have evaded the net so far , and on Tuesday skipper MS Dhoni backed the world body 's decision to take a hard line on suspect actions . " What we need to see is what is right and what 's wrong. There are a lot of bowlers with clean actions , people like Ravindra Jadeja , Amit Mishra . If you do n't have a good action , you have a slight advantage over the others . " Definitely what is legal should be allowed , and what 's not legal is for the ICC to decide. I feel no undue advantage should be given to anyone. Definitely , I feel it 's a good decision to clamp down. Otherwise , it 's unfair on the bowlers who have good clean actions. If you have a suspect action , then you 'll have to get it cleared and then come up and play. We have to appreciate people with clean actions. I 'm not taking anybody 's name , but the general agenda of what I 'm saying is it 's important to keep it ( wrong actions ) out of cricket , " said Dhoni . " I feel it 's good that the ICC is going hard , because if we are close to the borderline , then we will face the pressure. It 's a crucial decision. I 'm happy with the way it 's going , just that they have to be consistent with it. We ca n't really go ahead with the big names or small names. If somebody has a suspect action , he should go through the corrections. " Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
