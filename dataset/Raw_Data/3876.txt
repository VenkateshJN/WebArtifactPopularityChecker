Kevin Pietersen not in England plans , says selector The author has posted comments on this article Reuters | Mar 18 , 2015 , 09.19PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 LONDON : Kevin Pietersen 's wish for an England recall is unlikely to come true any time soon , according to selector James Whitaker who says the 34-year-old is not part of his plans . The swashbuckling middle-order batsman , sacked in 2014 , said he would " do anything " to regain his place when he talked to BBC radio on Wednesday , a few hours before England 's squad for next month 's tour to the West Indies was named . " We have n't had discussions at all about Kevin , " Whitaker told Sky Sports after naming his 16-strong party. " This last 12 months we 've been succesfully rebuilding the Test team and he 's not part of our plans. " " We 've produced some good middle-order players with Gary Ballance , Joe Root and Ian Bell continuing to perform well so we are happy with where we are in the middle order. " Pietersen , who scored 8,181 runs in 104 Tests for England , will play in the Indian Premier League next month although media reports suggest he is close to joining a county side for the forthcoming season . " I would love to get county runs , " he said. " If I can do anything that can help me get back into it for England then it 's something I want to do. I love playing for England. " Pietersen was given fresh hope of a recall at the start of this month when new England and Wales Cricket Board ( ECB ) chairman Colin Graves said he might have a chance of getting back if he resumed his county career . However , Graves ' suggestion was quickly knocked back by an ECB statement that said " nothing has changed " .
