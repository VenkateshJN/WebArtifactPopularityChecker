Memorable moments - Inzamam ends Kiwi frenzy The author has posted comments on this article TNN | Feb 7 , 2015 , 11.53AM IST Page 1 of 4 1992 : New Zealand vs Pakistan Inzamam-ul-Haq had managed just 123 runs in eight matches of World Cup prior to the semifinals . However , captain Imran Khan did n't have second thoughts about giving the young , portly batsman a long rope . Imran 's gamble turned into a masterstroke when Inzamam slammed 60 off 37 ( 7x4s , 1x6 ) for the 87-run fifth-wicket partnership with Javed Miandad ( 57 * ) . Needing 124 runs in about 15 overs , in a stiff chase of 263 , Pakistan won with an over to spare . It is largely believed that the absence of Martin Crowe ( 91 ) , who could not take the field , hurt the home team badly as stand-in captain John Wright was found wanting . While that could be right , it should be noted that Pakistan had hammered Kiwis in the league match three days before the semis in Crowe 's presence . The fact is that Inzamam 's blistering attack stunned the highly-disciplined and intense Kiwi attack into submission . CUP IN NUMBERS 7 : Just three bowlers have bagged seven wickets in a World Cup innings -Glenn McGrath : 7 for 15 vs Namibia at Potchefstroom on February 27 , 2003 ; Andy Bichel : 7 for 20 vs England at Port Elizabeth on March 2,2003 and Winston Davis : 7 for 51 vs Australia at Leeds on June 11 , 1983 . 15 : Number of duck victims claimed by Glenn McGrath in 39 matches -the most by a bowler in World Cup history.
