Plus , Test bowlers with the fewest five-fors , boundary-filled ODI innings , and a cricketer nicknamed Lugs shares Andrew Flintoff , holder of 226 Test wickets , has only three five-fors to his name © Getty Images Glenn Maxwell hit 15 fours in the tri-series final , but was out for 95. Is this the most boundaries in an innings which fell short of a century ? asked Azweer from India I was surprised to discover that Glenn Maxwell , during his 95 against England in Perth , was the 13th batsman to hit 15 fours in an ODI innings of less than 100. Three of the others hit a six as well , while Sachin Tendulkar - in his 82 against New Zealand in Auckland in 1993-94 - managed two sixes as well as 15 fours. But even that 's not a record : there are six cases of 16 fours ( three of them by Tendulkar ) , and one of 17 ( and a six ) , by Chris Gayle in his 85 for West Indies against Zimbabwe in Kandy in 2001-02. But leading the way , with no fewer than 19 fours in a 66-ball innings of 97 not out , is Herschelle Gibbs , for South Africa against Bangladesh in Benoni in 2002-03. Gibbs had scored centuries in his previous three ODIs , but was stranded just short of an unprecedented four in a row when South Africa won the match. Gibbs ' total of 76 runs in an ODI innings of less than hundred was matched by Marcus Trescothick , with 16 fours and two sixes , for England against Pakistan at The Oval in 2003 . Is Steven Smith the youngest player to captain Australia in a one-day international ? asked Ricky Dooley from Scotland Steven Smith was 25 years 235 days old when he captained Australia in a one-day international for the first time , against England in Hobart last month. The only younger man to captain them in an ODI was Kim Hughes , who was 25 years 134 days old when he took charge for the first time , against England at Lord 's during the 1979 World Cup. The Aussies come in quite a way down the overall list , which is headed by 20-year-old Rajin Saleh of Bangladesh. However , there is one younger Australian : Meg Lanning was only 21 years 300 days old when she captained for the first time in a women 's one-day international , against England in Melbourne in January 2014 . Ishant Sharma has taken 187 wickets in 61 Tests , at an average of nearly 40 , and managed only six five-wicket hauls. Does anyone have worse figures than this ? asked Raj Kumar Bansal from India Of the 171 bowlers who have now taken 100 or more Test wickets , there are 11 with worse averages than Ishant Sharma 's , which is currently 37.30. Easily the worst of all the 100-wicket men is the West Indian allrounder Carl Hooper ( 114 at 49.42 ) , and then come Nicky Boje ( South Africa ; 100 at 42.65 ) , Ravi Shastri ( India ; 151 at 40.96 ) , Mohammad Rafique ( Bangladesh ; 100 at 40.76 ) , Ashley Giles ( England ; 143 at 40.60 ) , Doug Wright ( England ; 108 at 39.11 ) , John Emburey ( England ; 147 at 37.87 ) , Paul Harris ( South Africa ; 103 at 37.87 ) , Fidel Edwards ( West Indies ; 165 at 37.87 ) , Dilhara Fernando ( Sri Lanka ; 100 at 37.84 ) and Phil Tufnell ( England ; 121 at 37.68 ) . Most of them are spinners , apart from Edwards and Fernando. As for five-wicket hauls , the only bowlers to have taken more wickets than Sharma with fewer five-fors are Andrew Flintoff ( 226 wickets , but only three five-wicket hauls ) and Jacques Kallis ( 292 and five ) . Garry Sobers ( 235 wickets ) and Morne Morkel ( currently 217 ) also took six five-fors . I noticed that India made the same total in both innings against Pakistan in Kolkata in 2004-05. How often has this happened ? asked Sivasakthivel from India That match in Kolkata in 2004-05 - when India made 407 in their first innings and 407 for 9 dec in their second - provided the eighth instance of a side making the same total in both innings of a match , and there has been one more since. It was also the highest ( and the first time India had passed 400 in both innings of any Test ) . The others were , in reverse order of size : Sri Lanka 306 and 306 against South Africa in Cape Town in 1997-98 ; New Zealand 279 and 279 against India in Hamilton in 2008-09 ; New Zealand 208 and 208 against West Indies in Wellington in 1955-56 ; India 201 for 9 and 201 against Australia in Sydney in 1980-81 ; New Zealand 172 and 172 against South Africa in Wellington in 1952-53 ; New Zealand 161 and 161 against Australia in Hobart in 1993-94 ; Bangladesh 148 and 148 against Pakistan in Chittagong in 2001-02 ; and India 136 and 136 against Australia in Calcutta ( now Kolkata ) in 1956-57 . Which Test cricketer was known as " Lugs " ? asked Jamie Barrett from Australia There may have been more than one , but the one I can track down is the New Zealand allrounder Chris Harris. He appeared in 23 Tests , but was more of a force in one-day internationals : he played in 250 of those , and took more than 200 wickets as well as scoring 4379 runs. I assume the name came about because of his prominent ears - which appeared to become even more prominent as his hair started to recede. Having said that , I usually remember him being called " Harry " by his team-mates - and that 's what he called his 1999 autobiography. His long-time team-mate Gavin Larsen seemed to think so , too : " Harry 's a marvellous guy and as a team man he ca n't be bettered , " he wrote. " The common phrase in the changing room is 'Shut up , Harry ! ' " Is James Anderson the most capped player for England in international cricket ? ? asked Sunit Kumar from the UAE I 'm not sure it was generally spotted , but James Anderson did indeed move ahead of Alec Stewart ( 303 international matches in all formats ) during the recent one-day series in Australia : the game in Hobart on January 23 was Anderson 's 304th in all. He now has 306 appearances - 99 in Tests , 188 in ODIs and 19 in Twenty20s. Paul Collingwood played exactly 300 matches for England in all formats ; next come Kevin Pietersen ( 275 ) , Ian Bell ( 268 ) and Stuart Broad and Graham Gooch ( 243 ) . Anderson is a long way down the overall list , which is headed by Sachin Tendulkar ( 664 matches ) and Mahela Jayawardene ( currently 645 ) .
