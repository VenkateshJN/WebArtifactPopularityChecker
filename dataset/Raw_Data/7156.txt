Kolkata Knight Riders v Mumbai Indians , IPL 2015 , Kolkata April 8 , 2015 KKR begin title defence with win at home 60 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Comment shares 60 Kolkata Knight Riders 170 for 3 ( Gambhir 57 , Suryakumar 46 , Pandey 40 ) beat Mumbai Indians 168 for 3 ( Rohit 98 * , Anderson 55 * ) by 7 wickets Play 02 : 25 'Knight Riders looked better prepared' We will be reminded time and again via highlights reel how the IPL is the breeding ground for the best fielding in the known universe , but what will not be mentioned is that on the opening night of its eighth edition seven catches were dropped. Kolkata Knight Riders let three slip , Mumbai Indians outdid them , and fittingly the defending champions got their campaign off to a victorious start . Morne Morkel was the one outstanding player on a night of otherwise unremarkable cricket , bowling four overs in one go for 18 runs and two wickets. That start from Morkel meant Mumbai were stifled for more than half of their innings , and despite the 88 they scored in the last six overs they were about 20 light. Helped by the sloppy fielding and ineffective bowling , Knight Riders were efficient in the chase with Gautam Gambhir scoring a fifty , and Manish Pandey and Suryakumar Yadav chipping in with forties . Knight Riders , especially at home , have relied on their superior bowling - if not to take wickets , at least to restrict sides and force them into making mistakes. Rohit Sharma , who scored 98 not out , was fluent right from the start , but Knight Riders were all over the rest of the top order. This was Rohit 's 10th fifty-plus score in an IPL defeat , the most by any batsman. Aaron Finch top-edged Morkel to put a brake on the runs. Aditya Tare chipped Shakib Al Hasan straight to long-off , neither looking to keep the ball down nor looking to hit a six. This would n't be Tare 's last mistake on the night . Tare 's wicket in the fifth over was a cue for Gambhir to go all out looking for wickets. Morkel bowled the sixth over with slips in place for Ambati Rayudu. Two balls in , Rayudu obliged , edging a short-of-a-length delivery straight to first slip. The wicket-maiden made it 37 for 3 after six. This is usually time when Knight Riders drive the nail in. They went to the returning Sunil Narine. He might not have looked as effective as he did with his old action , but this might be too early to pass judgement on that. His four overs still conceded only 28 , playing an important part in keeping Mumbai down to 80 for 3 after at the end of the 14th over . In the 15th over Rohit opened up , punishing some gentle length bowling from Umesh Yadav. Anderson had already been dropped at deep midwicket by Andre Russell. Rohit would soon be let off by wicketkeeper Robin Uthappa. In all the two batsmen would add a total of 60 runs since being dropped , but that was about to be overshadowed in the chase. If Mumbai carried any momentum from their finish , they lost it immediately with Tare dropping Gambhir for 1 . Uthappa was dropped too , but Anderson made sure he did n't cost Mumbai much. When Anderson next dropped somebody , it proved costlier. With Pandey chipping Harbhajan Singh down long-off , Anderson misjudged , ran in too far , and managed to get just one hand to it. Knight Riders were 74 for 1 in nine overs ; this was the time when Mumbai would have hoped to sneak back in , but they kept letting it slip . Gambhir kept hurting Mumbai , punishing every error with the ball , of which there were quite a few as bowlers other than Lasith Malinga and Vinay Kumar failed to stretch the batsmen. By the time Gambhir was dropped next , a tough chance off his own bowling by Harbhajan , the ricochet took him to a four that brought up his fifty. They needed just 57 off 40 now , and Suryakumar settled any remaining nerves with some clean flicks off the pads , two of them going all the way for six .

OLDEST Assertive-Indian on April 9 , 2015 , 10 : 06 GMT Rohit Sharma is like Viv Richards when he plays on pitches in India , against any bowler in the world. However , somehow , he does n't perform that well on pitches abroad. To be fair to him , he did score 144 runs in the first match of the ODI tri-series against the Aussies in Brisbane. But , after that , the only decent score he got was the century against BD. Against Pak he got out playing a silly shot , while against SA he was run out. He was looking good against the Aussies in the SF , but then got clean bowled by Johnson just after pulling him for a six. That is Rohit , in a nutshell ! on April 9 , 2015 , 9 : 53 GMT poor captaincy from rohit..... but excellent batting . some people are again starting stupid comments like where was he in world cup.... he scored 2nd highest individual runs for india. ....more than kohli and raina . CodandChips on April 9 , 2015 , 9 : 43 GMT @ JOSE PULIAMPATTA Agreed , Simmons for Pollard. Pollard generally does pretty well in IPL but I 'd say he 's been found wanting against certain international bowlers ( especially Steyn ) . While both Simmons and Pollard have been disappointing in international cricket I 'd say Simmons has improved a lot recently and had a decent world cup . on April 9 , 2015 , 8 : 51 GMT The main problem with mi is the they do n't have any reliable indian batsman in middle like they have dk in 2013 and auction was very poor they did not go for vijay and young indian batsman. mi is not using his foreign resources well also. bowling attach is looking very weak , no wicket taker bowler. pollard is not doing anything in the team. My X1 is : 1 ) Rohit , 2 ) Parthiv/chand , 3 ) simmons , 4 ) raydu,5 ) corey , 6 ) tare 7 ) Bhajji , 8 ) Gopal , 9 ) Malinga , 10 ) Hazelwood , 11 ) Vinay Kumar. This team is looking more balanced and better in attck asadaman on April 9 , 2015 , 8 : 38 GMT Where was rohit in world cup ? Perhaps rohit only can score / smash in home ground on April 9 , 2015 , 8 : 34 GMT We all now that an IPL team can field just four overseas players . Considering that constraint , MI should seriously consider Simmons in place of Pollard , and Josh in place of Malinga . on April 9 , 2015 , 8 : 27 GMT @ CODANDCHIPS ON APRIL 9 , 2015 , 7 : 12 GMT : I agree with your response to BRUTALANALYST , regarding Finch . I would still prefer playing Simmons ; but in place of Pollard , though . 11_Warrior on April 9 , 2015 , 8 : 11 GMT I am very keen to see how Malinga , Pollard , Harbhajan , Ojha perform this year . on April 9 , 2015 , 7 : 23 GMT MI do not have a good bowling attack.. they think Ojha is a frontline spinner.. how sad is that ? they 're # 5 and # 6 are average all rounders.. they 're there for their batting.. It 's a crime to not play Simmons when it was only him who got some wins under the belt for MI last season.. Finch over Simmons was a bit too much.. Bumrah was so terrible.. KKR has the best bowling attack and their batting will come undone soon.. it was more of bad bowling that won them the game today. . CodandChips on April 9 , 2015 , 7 : 12 GMT @ BRUTALANALYST Yeah Simmons was brilliant last year. And he had an excellent world cup. But do n't forget Finch is arguably the best opener in T20Is. Maybe he 'll be like Hales in the big bash- proven world class at international level , but could n't hack it in the big domestic league ? Though Finch did well in the T20 Blast last year tbf , though it 's hardly a big T20 league .

Too many cooks spoil the broth. Also selection was very poor . on April 9 , 2015 , 5 : 12 GMT Pollard and Malinga are burnt forces. Finch , Simmons , Anderson and Hazelwood needs to play. Also Mithun in place of Bumrah . on April 9 , 2015 , 5 : 10 GMT @ ANTONY_LUCAS ON APRIL 9 , 2015 , 3 : 40 GMT : Full credit to the excellent performance of Rohit Sharma & Cory Anderson . But , once again , it proves that cricket is game played by a TEAM , and not a forum for just display of the brilliance of a pair ( or two or a three ) of INDIVIDUALS ! unbiased_referee on April 9 , 2015 , 5 : 08 GMT I do n't quite understand whose wisdom is at work in playing two spinners and wasting valuable space in bowling department. Despite a good knock by Rohit Sharma [ discounting the let-offs gifted to him by KKR ] , he could n't control the proceedings after 90 mins in the game ! Reason ? battered up and out-of-gas recent end-of-WC campaign. While this will haunt all big stars of all IPL teams south of Calcutta , clangers in team selection such as this wo n't do them any good ! on April 9 , 2015 , 4 : 56 GMT Great knock by rohit and corey Raju_Iyer on April 9 , 2015 , 4 : 47 GMT Has Gautam Gambhir 's batting improved for him to be in the run for a place in the Indian team ? Unlikely based on this display. Has Yadav 's bowling suddenly deteriorated for him not to merit a place in the next international match that Team India plays ? Unlikely. Then why agonize too much over these games folks ? Just enjoy the action and appreciate good performances . on April 9 , 2015 , 4 : 24 GMT Drop malinga bring in josh sweetiepaper on April 9 , 2015 , 4 : 04 GMT Seems Mumbai has n't learnt anything from their mistakes from the early part of last season. Simmons turned it around for them at the top of the order yet they drop him. Last season they kept coming up short by 15/20 runs with big hitters still in the dugout. Anderson or Pollard must bat higher up the order with licence to go hard. If they only get 20 off of 10 balls then so be it. That would have made the difference today . Antony_Lucas on April 9 , 2015 , 3 : 40 GMT Not enough credit given to Rohit and Anderson for their batting recovery. 168 was an against the odds comeback , the MI bowlers just were n't good enough to defend the total. MI probaby 2 players short of a title threatening team - need another local batter in the top 6 and another pacer of international standard on April 9 , 2015 , 3 : 17 GMT In the preview , Muthu talked about MI 's " Vast Think Tank " . Yes , vast , but not deep. Not deep enough to sink the opposition. I had been commenting For the past few years about their think tank being large enough to field yet another team in the IPL. Who knows , their budget could be as big as the team 's itself . The problem with that vast think tank is just that : VAST. But does n't look good enough to think DEEP. They might have been deep thinkers , at individual levels , during their playing days ; but not now as a 'group " . Otherwise how can they justify playing Pollard who wrote more columns than the games played in recent months ? How can you explain benching Simmons ? The list is long.. . Legaleagle on April 9 , 2015 , 1 : 06 GMT Great game to kick start the IPL. Although jot a nail-biter but a promo that IPL is not about just hitting 6s and 4s . mfislam on April 8 , 2015 , 22 : 46 GMT Outstanding morkel , pandey and surya. You ca n't get gg with the spin , poor rohit. Narin will get better , he would have an still amazing figure had robin not dropped that chance , chawla , russel , shakib started well but failed to hanging there in the end , shakib a bit unlucky though still I dint love the way he tossed up the bowl. Good luck kkr victortrumpet on April 8 , 2015 , 22 : 31 GMT How can Mumbai expect to win without their Australian fast bowler ? Put in Hazelwood and drop Finch.. . __PK on April 8 , 2015 , 21 : 47 GMT The breeding ground for the best fielding in the universe ? So the great fielders of the IPL learnt their fielding skills in India ? In the IPL ? No , it 's the retirement home of the best fielding in the universe . CluelessJan on April 8 , 2015 , 21 : 09 GMT a bowler who gives 12 runs per over in 4 overs is no good whatever the circumstances is in t20. that means 240 runs for the opposition . adi133 on April 8 , 2015 , 20 : 57 GMT Although mumbai lost the match , there were few positives they can take from it. Rohit 's form was always crucial for them and him being in form will mean a good season for them. Corey did struggled but that was a solid knock keeping in mind the pro-spin wicket at Eden. However finch needs to prove his worth as an overseas players. He can get another 1-2 chances otherwise there is Simmons backing up. Also playing 5 bowlers when you have 2 all-rounders does n't makes sense. I think parthiv and shreyas should come in for bumrah and ojha. For KKR , if their batting keeps performing this way then man , they 're going to be the team to beat this season . on April 8 , 2015 , 20 : 28 GMT KkR is winning because of players like Manish Pandey and Suryakumar Yadav and Manvinder Bisla in the past.When Mumbai will understand the value of young indian players like Unmukth Chand , Hardik Pandya and shreyas Gopal ? BRUTALANALYST on April 8 , 2015 , 20 : 17 GMT In regards to Narine I was very impressed. Despite the huge pressure he handled it well he still has carrom ball almost or did capture Corey LBW who did n't pick it throughout I guess bowling to Rohit majority of time one of the best batsman might have skewed things a lil but he also had him caught behind if Robin had n't let it slip away which was before he got taken for biggest over early days but signs show he can still be competitive with this new action . SultanofSwing007 on April 8 , 2015 , 20 : 11 GMT Great win for KKR , hope they are on a roll ! The big worry - and it may be too early for that - is whether Narine can bowl as effectively as before with his new form. Down the road he has to do well in order for KKR to succeed. There are too many teams out there who are strong on all fronts this season. RCB with De Villiers , Kohli and Gayle are intimidating batsmen , and either one of them could comprhensively dominate a match. Well hope its an exciting IPL season , the jets are just getting warmed up for a blast boys ! ! on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 53 GMT Mumbai Indians just do not seem to have that team which can instill confidence in the supporters.The team combination is also not right and the foreign players who played today were also not up to the mark. KKR seems to have a better team combination and a great bowling unit combined with some exciting batsmen which should serve them well in the tournament . MAN_AT_WORK on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 48 GMT Bad luck Shakib should end up with 3 wickets , Gambhier played well Morkal is class , Suurya and pandit played well ..Good luck KKR on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 37 GMT @ Om Prakash and Jerry , two absolute sitters were dropped from Shakib 's bowling. Had those catches been taken , MI would have folded and Shakib would not have given 48 off 4 . FTBRocks on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 11 GMT is suryakumar yadav a latest entry in elite club of swapnil asnodkar IndianBarcafan on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 07 GMT Great bowling display by Morne Morkel , good batting by Rohit but just not enough as KKR outbatted them great cameos by Manish Pandey , what an innings by young Surya ! ! ! strange captaincy by Rohit Sharma as for some strange reasons he took off his pace bowlers and put spinners on at both end.Umesh Yadav while he was bowling decided to forgo bowling short which had served him so well in the World Cup.Fantastic to see a packed Eden Gardens , good all-round pitch and outfield was like a lush carpet . on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 03 GMT I take it that reference to the IPL having great fielding was sarcasm : ) Even with Narine 's new action he looked a class above Shakib Al Hasan. He is a good all rounder but his numbers are inflated with performances against weak international teams. His averages are close to Shane Watson 's but he is considered a star while Watson is considered disappointing . on April 8 , 2015 , 19 : 02 GMT If MI wants to play 5 bowlers they should play hazelwood in place of finch and patel in place of bumrah. Patel is a good batsmen , can give steady start to MI . on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 54 GMT Suryakumar yadav played with great style hitting effortless sixes. He looks to be a future India player. Rohit,manish and gambhir also looked in good touch. Only Corey Anderson was a bit subdued scoring slowly by his standards BRUTALANALYST on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 41 GMT @ CodandChips Large reason to turn around was Simmons 400 form 8 game @ 56 with S/R of 136 yet they decided to drop him. Finch last year av 28 S/R 117 and his overall IPl stats are even worse despite the big money he gets he does n't seem to deliver in India he can turn it around but still leaving out Simmons after his performance last year seems like madness to me as does playing Pollard if you 're not going to bat or bowl him tactics overall are terrible . crrkiran on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 38 GMT malinga is over the hill. his performance will start to come down from now on on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 35 GMT Mumbai should look into dropping Pollard for Hazlewood. Those who are calling for Finch to be dropped , relax. It 's just one game. Have absolutely no idea why we keep insisting on playing Ojha though. Overall a good game , thought we batted really well after going down to 37-3. Was delighted to see Rohit open the innings and bat all the way through . junkRG on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 30 GMT I think the think tank got the lineup wrong today. choosing 5 bowlers + corey and pollard leaves the batting lineup too short. Rohit/corey would probably have batted more freely had pollard not been the last known batsman after them. Should have gone with parthiv in place of bumrah. Early days though , am sure they will tinker with the lineup initially before settling with the final 11 . on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 21 GMT Sheesh , Mumbai 's bowling attack looks really weak. Malinga and Vinay Kumar supported by some club level bowlers. Also , why give Gambhir so many overs of ( sub-par ) spin so he can flay the bowling ? What happened to the bouncers ? Even a low quality one from Bumrah was enough to get his wicket. Epic Fail by Ponting and Rohit Sharma ( the captain not the batsman ) . on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 15 GMT Since last IPL I just ca n't understand what is happening to Anderson when he plays in IPL. After an outstanding performance in WC again today he looked like an average local player. His body language is totally puzzling everybody. Is is he the same Anderson we saw in semifinal against mighty SA ? Mumbai today lost the match because of mainly very bad fielding. When a player like Gambhir gets life on 4 , you ca n't just excuse. Pande , Uthhappa everybody got life. And it was a strange decision playing Tare than Parthiv. In both keeping & batting class , Parthiv is much much better. Finally hats of to skipper Rohit. Brilliant Capatains inning of 98. He is geniuses ! ! All the best MI . SamRoy on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 14 GMT I disagree that Morkel was the only outstanding player. Rohit handled Morkel without any fuss and played brilliantly. Suryakumar Yadav just looked that he was handling club bowlers. IMO all three of them Mokel , Rohit and Surya were outstanding ; the rest were very ordinary. ( Gambhir is still excellent against spin but has a lost of his ability against pace ) . Fahim_Bd_1998 on April 8 , 2015 , 18 : 12 GMT Bad luck for Shakib , he started well but unluckily ended up giving lots of runs. He could have finished his spell well if those two catches were taken and midfield. Anyways , good Shakib for his last match for KKR . Fahim_Bd_1998 on April 8 , 2015 , 17 : 59 GMT Bad luck for Shakib , he started well but unluckily ended up giving lots of runs. He could have finished his spell well if those two catches were taken and midfield. Anyways , good Shakib for his last match for KKR . on April 8 , 2015 , 17 : 58 GMT The Mumbai Indians bench team looks stronger than the on drops team CodandChips on April 8 , 2015 , 17 : 58 GMT Great from KKR. Morkel set the tone up top with that brilliant spell , but Sharma showed his class and Anderson his fight to recover. Maybe they should have gone earlier , but their batting lineup is n't that deep. KKR chased well , but Mumbai will be concerned with the ease that they did it with. Both teams also need to look at their fielding . People may question Mumbai , but do n't forget they started off terribly last year and still qualified. Their team last year way weaker than normal , and I question how strong it is now. Sharma and Finch are class , but they bat only to 6 , with both Pollard and Anderson quite hit and miss. Their bowling is too reliant on Malinga , who has had is injury issues . bumble23 on April 8 , 2015 , 17 : 51 GMT The ease with which the batsman hit sixes thanks to bringing the ropes further and further inside would sooner or later turn cricket into more of a baseball game. Eventhough the cricket pundits are urging to even the balance between ball and bat the cricket officals seem to ignore it. Absolutely pathetic . on April 8 , 2015 , 17 : 50 GMT @ Blade - The same Shakib who went for 48 in his 4 overs today. KKR could have lost the match because of him. Good that he will leave after 2 matches. KKR can play Ryan Ten D in place of him . on April 8 , 2015 , 17 : 49 GMT Mumbai Indians need to change bowling attack ...... Mr Ambani need to spent good money on bowlers... . FiGhtCluB_99 on April 8 , 2015 , 17 : 32 GMT Surya Yadav has been an impressive player. He does not have the best batting technique but makes up for it with some clever shots. He 's a good fielder too and handy part-time bowler. I liked how Gambhir mentioned him at the toss . blade_walker on April 8 , 2015 , 17 : 25 GMT shakib the best,without him KKR cant win any matches,Good luck to worlds no1 allrounder . on April 8 , 2015 , 16 : 38 GMT Aakash Chopra and Navjot Sidhu , need to watch out more on your words and stick to cricket. If you want to joke , joke....dont pass personal remarks. If you dont like KKR , dont show it on tv. Shoaib akhtar being a outsider is better. Dont have a choice but to watch your commentary on SONY MAX . Starvybz on April 8 , 2015 , 16 : 33 GMT In Narine 's defence he would have gotten a wicket but Uthappa dropped it and then afterwards went for ten runs so not really a bad day for him. That being said his pace has gotten slower . sweet2hrme on April 8 , 2015 , 16 : 09 GMT So Naraine episode is started but he Never looks too threatening now with his new bowling action.
