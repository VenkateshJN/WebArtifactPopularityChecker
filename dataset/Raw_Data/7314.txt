OLDEST on April 13 , 2015 , 10 : 09 GMT For me 1999 best ever world cup best format the most competitive world cup the ups and downs of that world cup was just amazing at one stage australia required to win 6 or 7 matches in a row to stay in the competition after losing against new zealand and pakistan and also against all top teams they manage to do that even a tie in semi final no one knew whats going to happen who will go through which team will win it was so tense probably the last best world cup . on April 13 , 2015 , 9 : 03 GMT When did Bangladesh and zimbabwe became a major side for you.Infact in 2007 bangladesh were also a minnow they rarely used to win in those days just like zimbabwe these days they are also like ireland why are you so desperate to show me that they have done miracles beating 3 good teams in 3 world cup.1 match per world cup . on April 13 , 2015 , 8 : 28 GMT When two weak teams play ofcourse there will be an interesting match like when two strong teams play against each other what so interesting about that.You get good matches in ranji and county cricket as well becuase of evenly matched teams.Anyway i hope icc stays with their decision this time unlike after 2011 when they were forced to change that.How many major teams did ireland beat in this world cup i guess 1 and they were so close to be beaten by zim infact zim was so unlucky that they lost it for 1 bad decison of ervine.Like in in 2007 and 2011 they beat only 1 major teams rest of the tournament they remained ordinary . on April 13 , 2015 , 8 : 20 GMT Amit - But in the recent poll 2011 world cup was rated as the 3rd most boring world cup with over 13k votes infact that numbers could have been much higher if india were unable to win that.What was interesting about that world except india won the league round was useless all top 8 teams were as expected through to qf.Only there were close matches which also did n't matter because at the end they would have gone through beating minnows.Now tell me how are you sure that in just two weeks we will be able to find out 4 sfs in 2019 when each team plays 2 or 3 matches in 2 weeks also not against minnows but equally matches teams and overall each team will play total of 9 league matches so even if few manage to get on top of the pool earlier they can easily come down if they do n't perform in the later part of the tournament atleast not a usless league stage like this . on April 12 , 2015 , 9 : 56 GMT Shantanu - If head to head was used , Ireland would have been in the quarter-finals and not West Indies. And this world cup was boring due to the ODI rules. With exactly the same format , 2011 world cup is said to be the best ever world cup. It was the 4 fielder rule and the 2 balls rule which made ODIs too much in favour of the batsmen & the world cup as boring. And full members like England & West Indies contributed to the world cup being boring. 6 out of 7 knock out matches were not even close. Since 2007 , England have managed to win only 4 matches against the top 11 teams in world cups ( 2007-IRE&WI , 2011-SA&WI ) . And in the same period , Ireland won 5 matches against the top 11 teams ( 2007-PAK&BAN , 2011-ENG , 2015-WI&ZIM ) And still England is getting a free entry and Ireland is not getting Associates were the ones who made this world cup interesting and gave us some memorable matches , taking out associates will make the 2019 " world " cup as dull & boring with a highly predictable top 4 on April 12 , 2015 , 6 : 24 GMT Amit - If that will be a boring world cup then i dont know which one is going to be interesting.And if ireland is good enough then they can easily qualify for that edition why they are crying just because they know even if they qualify they have to beat atleast 4 or 5 test playing nation to go through to 2nd round which is next to impossible for them.By the way in the recent poll this wc has been voted as the most boring one over 40k votes so you want another boring edition in 2019 for god sake do n't make a wc joke once again.Even icc wanted to cut this edition into 10 teams but i do n't know why they changed their decision and made a mess of it.And if asking about who the top 8 teams would be well the most easy question top 8 test playing nations bang can be the other no changes . mihir_nam on April 12 , 2015 , 6 : 17 GMT @ SHANTANU for beating big teams regularly u need to play them regularly which ICC is not letting happen , Sri Lanka in 79 Defeated India , and 83 New Zealand , and 96 They were Champions. Kenya were far more superior than Bangladesh in 2003 , Kenya had already defeated India Twice In World Cup Kenya did n't come as Favourites but as ODI status team associates . What they achieved was more greater than Bangladesh or Zimbabwe And even South Africa who failed to beat any big teams lost to Windies New Zealand Tie with Lanka , What they were expecting beating minnows and going in Super Six . Scots Afghans are improving sides. Give them regular fixtures u can not determine in One off ODI. People do n't talk just cause they beat one big team,its appreciation of their effort without exposure. So in your case only 6-7 Teams should play world cup. ireland will get bowlers if they get fixtures Tom Curran and Matt Dunn have Irish Passports now i guess , Boyd can be brought back . on April 12 , 2015 , 5 : 29 GMT Shantanu , why r u so much fighting for a 10 team world cup , which will have a dull boring round robin , where in the 1st 2 weeks , everyone will know who the 4 semi-finalists will be. In the current format , we did n't get to know about quarter-finalists till the very last group match & Ireland missed out only on NRR And if u already know who the top 8 will be , can u tell the top 8 , top 4 , finalists & winners for 2019 ? Ireland , Afghanistan & Scotland are improving and will do well if given proper chances. Ireland is just 1 world class bowler away from being a top team. Once they get some good bowlers , expect Ireland to be amongst the top 5 ODI teams on April 11 , 2015 , 15 : 58 GMT For all those who claims a 10 team world cup will be like a champions trophy let me remind you icc never used round robin format for any champions trophy or world t20.For champions trophy they make two groups of 4 then semis and final.Hence 10 team round robin is a different story all together its way too tough than any other format . on April 11 , 2015 , 6 : 29 GMT @ MIHIR_NAM - So what its been a long story in each edition one or two weak teams does well they beat one big team and few other minnows and everyone start thinking oh they are a very good side i do n't agree at all.If kenya would have beaten new zealand,south africa and 1 more big team in that wc i would have agreed it will happen in any wc 1 of the big team will lose a match if they have a off day like in 1996 when wi lost to kenya that does n't mean they are well enough to compete at the big stage.First they have to start beating major teams consistently for that icc have to organise them a platform and only after that they are allowed to enter in such high quality premier event because how many times i have to say wc is the stage where you improve your cricket but it is the stage to deliver and perform the standard which is required at top level . on April 13 , 2015 , 10 : 09 GMT For me 1999 best ever world cup best format the most competitive world cup the ups and downs of that world cup was just amazing at one stage australia required to win 6 or 7 matches in a row to stay in the competition after losing against new zealand and pakistan and also against all top teams they manage to do that even a tie in semi final no one knew whats going to happen who will go through which team will win it was so tense probably the last best world cup . on April 13 , 2015 , 9 : 03 GMT When did Bangladesh and zimbabwe became a major side for you.Infact in 2007 bangladesh were also a minnow they rarely used to win in those days just like zimbabwe these days they are also like ireland why are you so desperate to show me that they have done miracles beating 3 good teams in 3 world cup.1 match per world cup . on April 13 , 2015 , 8 : 28 GMT When two weak teams play ofcourse there will be an interesting match like when two strong teams play against each other what so interesting about that.You get good matches in ranji and county cricket as well becuase of evenly matched teams.Anyway i hope icc stays with their decision this time unlike after 2011 when they were forced to change that.How many major teams did ireland beat in this world cup i guess 1 and they were so close to be beaten by zim infact zim was so unlucky that they lost it for 1 bad decison of ervine.Like in in 2007 and 2011 they beat only 1 major teams rest of the tournament they remained ordinary . on April 13 , 2015 , 8 : 20 GMT Amit - But in the recent poll 2011 world cup was rated as the 3rd most boring world cup with over 13k votes infact that numbers could have been much higher if india were unable to win that.What was interesting about that world except india won the league round was useless all top 8 teams were as expected through to qf.Only there were close matches which also did n't matter because at the end they would have gone through beating minnows.Now tell me how are you sure that in just two weeks we will be able to find out 4 sfs in 2019 when each team plays 2 or 3 matches in 2 weeks also not against minnows but equally matches teams and overall each team will play total of 9 league matches so even if few manage to get on top of the pool earlier they can easily come down if they do n't perform in the later part of the tournament atleast not a usless league stage like this . on April 12 , 2015 , 9 : 56 GMT Shantanu - If head to head was used , Ireland would have been in the quarter-finals and not West Indies.

That was only game against Kiwi 's Rest , Pathetic New Full Member Bangladesh lost to Kenya , Sri Lanka it was enough for them and then they defeated Good Zimbabwean Side to Enter semi 's . Yes Semi 's was one-sides so was India Australia in 2015 . well 14-16 team is good idea..as this is not a Champions Trophy , It 's simply can not happen that once Champions Trophy also had 12 teams. And and 10 Team WC will also be predictable Just like anyother WC 's top 4 always make it to Semi 's . If you really want to see a surprise then 14 Team was good..Ireland missed by Whisker..They should have batted first against UAE and piled runs , Ireland is fit to Enter Test Area with first few years playing against Zim Ban WIN Srl and if ICC is so keen on 10 Team WC then please make all 16 Teams play each other in 3ODi 's Home and Away or atleast Home of Big team ...then select Best 10 teams and move with WC19 on April 11 , 2015 , 5 : 45 GMT @ AMIT SHUKLA - Long drawn happens when you already know even before the start of the world cup who are going to play qfs like in 2011 and 2015 ( only 1 change bang ) how can you predict in 10 team round robin world cup which 6 teams will be left out till the very end when each team need to win atleast 4 or 5 matches against top nations to qualify for semis it is thousand times better than this rubbish format that is why icc is going for it . on April 10 , 2015 , 19 : 15 GMT Shantanu , 1 side u say u support associates and still u do n't want associates to be a part of world cup and u propose a long drawn out 10 team " world " cup. I would suggest ICC goes with 16 teams in 2 groups of 8 , but have 2 matches each day and then IPL style playoffs instead of quarter-finals. The WC will still get over in about 40 days despite increase in matches. The 56 match long group stage done in just 28 days and about 12 more days for the playoffs And no way the quarter-finalists were decided. Ireland were in contention till the very last match and would have even qualified if head to head was taken instead of NRR. If anything , the 4 semi-finalists were the ones everyone know. It was well known in 2007 and also in 2015 that which 4 teams will make it to the semis. And with a long drawn out league in 2019 , we will again know the semis in just 1st 2 weeks of the world cup before the interest dies down and everyone will wait for the semis to begin Rakesh_Sharma on April 10 , 2015 , 19 : 00 GMT Ireland must stop asking for support if they still wants to be associate and play against top nations. Ireland must rightfully fight for Test status and Full member. This way they will automatically get games. I am many times doubting the intentions of Ireland since they are not forceful of lobbying for Test status. If they get Full membership they will gey lot of ODI and T20 .They can than play odd one or two test matches . Sandeep1219 on April 10 , 2015 , 8 : 51 GMT @ Shantanu - Yes that is the problem right now.ICC or the other top teams cricket broads are reluctant to arrange games for Ireland,Afghanistan etc.,with their teams.ICC CEO Dave Richardson says that they can not guarantee matches for associates with top teams.It 's sad to see Ireland have only 2 ODI 's in 2015 right now.With out regular games against top teams they are not going to improve as a team.Seriously what other options does Associate teams have other than asking for playing in the World Cups and even that opportunity is being taken from them.First these top Associates should be included in FTP and have at least one home and away three matches of ODI 's and 20/20 's with all the top teams in four year 's before world cup.That way they can improve as a team and then they will be competitive in World Cups to follow . on April 10 , 2015 , 8 : 45 GMT @ SANDEEP In 2003 kenya was so lucky that they just able to upset sri lanka and got to the semi final which indeed was an one sided affair.The reason they got threw was england and new zealand did n't wanted to play in keny for security reason hence they got walkover and sufficient points to qualify for semis . on April 10 , 2015 , 8 : 37 GMT Round robin is the best format which was used in 1992 and it still been used in ipl with great success.That is why ipl is much tougher to win than the world cup becuase there u get no easy games and it is a double round robin but for 50 overs single round robin is enough and 10 teams instead of 8 its the best way to decide the world instead of making useless groups why you need to divide teams in groups lets each team play each other to decide who is the best. @ Sandeep the format you talking about was used in 2004 champions trophy hence that is not the way to decide a world champion . on April 10 , 2015 , 8 : 24 GMT @ SANDEEP - But after they qualified what they did in the entire tournament just made up the numbers it can happen 9 out of 10 times they will lose to good teams it does n't mean they are better than full members.I am not at all against associates but first they have to be that good to compete at the biggest stage icc should organise such tournaments were they able to play more games against good teams but putting them straight into the world cup makes the standard of the tournament low.Becuase it is not the stage to improve your cricket but teams who already improved to play high quality cricket should be part of it . Sandeep1219 on April 10 , 2015 , 8 : 22 GMT I 'll go with the views of cricket greats like Sachin , Dravid,Jayawardene.I hate to use the term Associates but they are playing some good cricket , give them the opportunity they deserve. The more cricket those guys play , the more international cricket , I think they will develop as a team - not only Ireland & Afghanistan , but a lot of the other Associate teams.It 'll be a backward step with 10 team world cup which cricket may have to regret in the future.Look at Kenya in 2003 world cup and where they are now.They should have been included in the Future Tours Programme ( FTP ) at least in the ODI 's after 2003 world cup . Sandeep1219 on April 10 , 2015 , 7 : 57 GMT @ SHANTANU - Seriously twisting facts.In 2007 there were 16 teams with 4 groups and 6 matches in the group.If everyone knows those 8 teams to qualify for next round then how did top teams like IND and PAK got knocked out in first round.Did anyone expect that IRE and BAN will be in those 8 teams..NO..In 2007 after group stages it should have been QF 's , SF 's and Final instead of the Super 8 's.ICC is in a total mess right now with no vision for the improvement of associate team . on April 10 , 2015 , 7 : 24 GMT 16 teams 4 groups 6 matches in each group why they play those matches ? Do n't Know , Does these matches have any value ? No , Which are the 8 teams will qualify for qfs ? Everyone knows like in 2011 and 2015 ( except bang rest all were same ) Then why they play the league round ? Do n't know on April 10 , 2015 , 6 : 46 GMT @ SNE SCHINKEL - ok , I can agree with that argument that even the FIFA giants need to qualify for the tournament and that there is no freebie ; the example to highlight there mainly was that just because some countries can bring in " TRP " ratings does not mean they get to waltz into the tournament. Also , honestly how much is FIFA helping India to get in by supplying them matches against the top tier countries ? It is not Argentina , Brazil , England , France , Germany , Italy , Spain , or Uruguay ( like you mention ) - we only get teams primarily from the Asian confederation because those are the ones with equal level as our capabilities. This in itself equates to the concept of " Associates " ... I do agree that the top 8 should not just walk in based on past pedigree . on April 10 , 2015 , 6 : 03 GMT The league round in 14 team wc should be renamed as practice matches for 1 month for qfs beacuse they are indeed practice games.Unless you practice really really poorly like england you will go through to qf . on April 10 , 2015 , 5 : 57 GMT ( 2/2 ) If India wants to play in a world cup ( they qualified for the 1950 one ) , they have to follow the same qualifying proc ess any other Asian team has to , no favourites there , just the same rules for everyone . I say , 4 groups , 4 teams each , quarter finals. Make it so that no team can really afford to lose any matches - that 's the best way to ensure excitement. All this talk about large groups , super sixes... A super six round with 4 teams going through means 15 matches to get rid of two teams . Oh , and for good measure : Try and minimize automatic qualification. Maybe not reduce it to only the host , but at best only the semi-finalists of the previous world cup. Stop it with the freebies . The associates and affiliates do n't want freebies. They want the freebies to stop . on April 10 , 2015 , 5 : 56 GMT ( 1/2 ) @ Saleel Pradhan : I ca n't believe nobody has pointed this out yet , but here goes : " Here is the way I see it. Do we like football ? Yes. Do we like 32 teams ? Yes. If they include India wouldnt we all fill up stadiums like Ireland is talking about in this article ? Yes. Does that mean FIFA gives India a freebie ? NO. " No , India do n't get a freebie from FIFA . Neither do Argentina , Brazil , England , France , Germany , Italy , Spain , or Uruguay ( to name just the previous winners of the cup ) , or any of the other traditional powerhouses. Only the host qualifies automatically for a finals tournament , not even the title-holder gets that privilige anymore . That means that much fancied countries like the Netherlands can fail to qualify for a world cup , like they did for the 2002 edition. They also do n't get any freebies in qualifying for the European Championships , and are currrently struggling in their group , trailing the Czech Republic and bloomin ' Iceland . on April 10 , 2015 , 5 : 00 GMT 1992 world cup the most successful till date 1999 and 2003 was the best two formats icc just messed it up becuase they afraid if india got knocked out in league then it will be a great loss to the viewers around the world like in 2007 so for that reason they introduced this rubbish format in 2011 in which it does n't matter if india play good or bad they will play 1 month for sure so its not risky but now they also fed up and want to make the tournament more competitive which according to me ian chappel,michael holding,ajit agarkar and others is a good idea.ICC should organise other tournaments for associates along with good teams and improve their standard so that in future they make it through to the premiere event.Twenty20 world cup should be about 20 teams i agree on that . on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 46 GMT @ SATISH - In that case i already know who those teams would be to play qfs unlike there would be an upset here and there top 7 or 8 teams will go through it means wc is just about 3 knockouts. @ SANDEEP Why are you comparing cricket with football you can not compare 8 hour game to 90 minutes yes they can increase number of teams for world t20. @ EDD OLIVER- Then why it is been rated the most boring wc ? and hats off to you if you really watched all of those matches you really deserve a trophy from icc.I do n't have any problem increase the number of teams as much as you want play 24 teams make as much group as you want see all the matches every weekend there will one big match when two strong teams play each other knowing that win or loss they will qualify for qf 95 % is gurantee. They all are like practice matches then 3 good games you are world chapions for 4 years hurray ! Sandeep1219 on April 10 , 2015 , 3 : 31 GMT @ Shantanu. I do n't understand your logic.World cup is a celebration of game for every 4 years.In Rugby also there are only 7 to 8 strong teams but they do n't talk about having only 10 team world cup.They still have a 20 team world cup in 2015 and are planning to increase teams in 2023 world cup.In Football also there are 12 strong teams but they have a 32 team world cup and FIFA is talking about 40 team world cup in the future.Cricket is the only game where it 's world cup is contracting instead of expanding.It is because of the present narrow minded attitude of the ICC.Cricket needs teams like Ireland,Afghanistan,Scotland,Papua New Guinea,Nepal,UAE,The Netherlands,Namibia,Kenya etc. , to grow as a game.And by the way there is another cricket world cup ? ( Champions Trophy 2017 ) in two years time for some people who want to watch only strong teams play in World Cups . VivGilchrist on April 10 , 2015 , 0 : 20 GMT @ Shantanu , I do n't get it. Going by your logic the FIFA World Cup would only have about 12 teams in it. After all , what chance are Bosnia , Honduras , or Australia of winning it ? It 's still a global celebration of the game. How about the Olympics ? It would only be between China and the USA.... . on April 9 , 2015 , 23 : 40 GMT @ Shantanu I stayed up or got up early to watch all of Afghanistan and Ireland 's games. I 'm bored of watching England ( my country ) lose continually so did n't both watching many of their games live. 16 teams , 2 groups of 8 but 2 matches per day , then QFs > SFs > Final , is the way to go. Something like 56 matches in 5 weeks. Myself and many other cricket fans are almost sick of watching the top 8 play each other over and over. Ireland , Afghanistan , Scotland , Nepal , the Netherlands , and even Bangladesh and Zimbabwe , who are given relatively little exposure compared to the Top 8 , all hold as much or more interest for me as England , Australia etc. The game needs to grow and expand beyond its current state where only 8 teams are deemed competitive ( which is incorrect ) . The ICC 's blinkered attitude , and that of some here who want a deadly dull 10 team round robin , will mean that the international game gradually withers and dies . kc69 on April 9 , 2015 , 21 : 55 GMT Those who are saying Ireland should come and play in Pakistan.Sorry to update that Kenya played in Pakistan before the world cup and nothing has changed for them.Moreover security is still a concern in Pakistan.Unfortunately the fate of Ireland rests on the Big3 of ICC and sadly irrespective of all these pleas I see very less hope for next world cup.However I think Ireland has what it takes to make it to the top 10 of 2019 WC through qualifiers.Who knows in english conditions they might give another blow to some team.My best wishes to Ireland and keep playing good cricket , you will be recognized one day for sure . mohsin9975 on April 9 , 2015 , 21 : 42 GMT Get rid of SCOT & UAE who played this CWC2015 & play 12 teams with group of 6 each , then top 3 of each group play a Super 6 stage followed by SF & Final. 48 matches in all. 1 fewer than 2015 but more matches between top sides. A format which keeps Top teams on their toes in the Group stage , offers more matches between Top sides during Super 6s & the excitement of KO during SFs & Final which gives enough opportunities to teams like IRE,AFG,ZIM,BAN & WI to cause rare upsets or show consistency enough to reach the Super 6s on April 9 , 2015 , 20 : 27 GMT Ireland should arrange triangular series with Bangladesh & Zimbabwe. In their condition it will be hard for Bangladesh. But hope it 'll be a good fight . Sathish8201 on April 9 , 2015 , 19 : 41 GMT @ SHANTANU - Do you math properly first.16 teams in 4 groups will be 24 group matches with every one playing each other once.Then top two teams in the group will play 4 QF 's. Then 2 SF 's and a final will make a total of 31 matches.The tournament will be over in one month with every match important.No pointless matches in the tournament at all . on April 9 , 2015 , 19 : 13 GMT I want to ask all of you who are in favour of associates should play in a world cup how many of you have watched matches of scotland,afghanistan,uae and other minor teams with great deal of interest i can gurantee not much there empty grounds making a wc dull.World Cup is a premier event it should be highly competitive all great players play in such tournament its a battle of best vs best.It is not the platform to improve your cricket or putting up the numbers it is the stage to deliver.ICC should organise other tournaments for associates to improve their cricket against top teams and if they really prove their self then they will make it through . on April 9 , 2015 , 18 : 36 GMT @ SATISH - Then that would have been the shortest world cup ever there were 4 groups of 16 teams. In each group there was 4 matches so 16 league matches and 4 qfs 2 sf and 1 final total of 23 matches that is it.So why not just play qfs instead common the wc is not just about 3 knockouts its more than that.1999 and 2003 were the best formats till date.But 2007 format was not that bad top eight teams playing against each other in a round robin phase it means each team need to win atleast 3 or more matches to qualify for the semi final just like the ipl in which each team plays twice against each other its a double round robin but for 50 over single round robin is enough and the winner will surely be the real world champion not just about 3 good days . Sathish8201 on April 9 , 2015 , 17 : 38 GMT @ Shantanu - I know the reasons for the 2007 world cup debacle and I agree with you on that.2007 world cup group stages were good.Who predicted that India and Pakistan will be knocked out in the group stages.But after that super 8 stage is lengthy & rubbish.It should have been straight knock outs after the group stages.I also agree 2015 format is bad and predictable.But that does n't mean associates should be left out for 2019.The problem is with the number of teams for 2019 and lack of regular competitive matches for top associate teams between world cups.Every one knows who those first 8 teams are going to be and remaining two spots in all probability will be Bangladesh ( Home Team in World Cup Qualifiers ) and one from Zimbabwe,Ireland or Afghanistan.One or no associate team from the likes of Ireland,Afghanistan,Scotland,The Netherlands,Papua New Guinea,Nepal is not good for cricket . manepali on April 9 , 2015 , 16 : 55 GMT Ireland , Nepal Holland and some of the emerging Associates teams should organize some kind of series together. May include one Test playing nation Zimbabwe or Bangladesh. That will elevate the level of cricket in other than Text playing nation. ICC should think about more play time for these game . TahirSheikh171 on April 9 , 2015 , 16 : 47 GMT come to Pakistan and play against PK. We are anxiously waiting for you guys too . on April 9 , 2015 , 15 : 40 GMT its sad to see that at present , ireland have only 2 odi 's planned for 2015 onwards , whereas other cricketing nations have more matches. this is just the sort of problem that porterfield has been saying for a long time - not enough matches against decent opposition. Why ca n't new zealand and australia play a couple of t20s odis and maybe a first class game or two before or after they tour england satyarad on April 9 , 2015 , 15 : 27 GMT For 2019 WC , May be ICC should consider Top 7 teams based on 2017 ODI rankings ( ( my guess , 1 Aus , 2 NZ , 3 SA , 4 IND , 5 PAK , 6 SL and 7 Eng ) and leave the remaining 3 positions to be fulfilled through a Qualifying tournament. WI , Zimbabwe , Bangladesh , Afghanistan , Ireland , Kenya , UAE , Scotland and Holland ( 9 teams ) would compete in this tournament and the Top 3 teams go through. This would put a lid to the " not having enough opportunities to improve their rating " theory of the Associates. Right now , they do n't have a level playing field to improve their ratings which is ridiculous from the ICC. Not sure , why ICC ca n't simplify things and provide more opportunities to the Associates . satyarad on April 9 , 2015 , 14 : 48 GMT I guess the associates need NOT worry about WORLD CUP participation. Instead , they ( and of course ICC ) should focus more on playing the A teams of TOP 5 teams in a four day matches.Also , include the Associate teams in Domestic tournaments of TOP 4 countries ( Ranji , County , Sheild , SA 's domestic tournament ) . say in Year 2015 , Ireland would play Sheild , Afganistan would play in Ranji , Kenya/UAE/Scotland would be playing the English county and SA 's.Rotate these teams among these competitions on a yearly basis so that in a four year period , they are more matured.Ever since the Associate teams participation in World Cup increased , many batting and bowling records are broken and contests became one sided. ICC did the right thing by reducing the team size to 10 for the next world cup. I would love to see AUS and SA match in this world cup and unfortunately it did not happen and the 2019 format would eliminate this . on April 9 , 2015 , 14 : 28 GMT @ Satish The question is not about associates but about the format infact i also voted for 2007 the most boring one and it was indeed but the format was not that bad even ganguly and dravid admitted it just because ind and pak did't make it to the 2nd round which could have made that wc somewhat interesting top 8 teams playing each other and 4 qualifying for semis that is competitive.The 2007 wc was not very well organised by icc the tickets rates was just too high and out of reach for locals the famous west indian bands were also not allowed in the ground and many such things...now the problem with this format is it is very predictable as even before the start of the wc i knew or most of us knew who the 8 qfs would be or there will be an unlickly upset like bangladesh otherwise everyone knew who are going to be those 7 or 8 teams in qfs...but in 10 team round robin format u ca n't predict whose going to be 4 semi finals and which 6 teams will be left out . on April 9 , 2015 , 13 : 58 GMT So , I looked into the 2015-17 ICC World Cricket League Championship , 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Two , and 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. All Ireland needs to do , is be in the final of a tournament involving ( at its current state ) - Bangladesh , Zimbabwe , Ireland , Afghanistan , Hong Kong , Kenya , Namibia , Nepal , Netherlands , and PNG. Is it just me , or is that not a fair argument by ICC to say , reach the final amongst these so-called " minnows " and make it in. I think it is fair. Ireland can almost consider itself the strongest team currently along with Bangladesh in this league. It seems Ireland only want a candy walk into the world cup tournament as if they deserve it due to 3-upset wins against Pakistan ( 2007 ) , England ( 2011 ) , and West Indies ( 2015 ) . I think they are good to be in the top 10 , but just go out and prove it , I 'm sure they can get in. I dont know why they think they are already eliminated . Sathish8201 on April 9 , 2015 , 13 : 39 GMT ICC should address these matters first 1 ) Standard ground sizes all around the world like 75-80 m from the center of the pitch.No more small grounds. 2 ) Restore bat & ball balance in the game. 3 ) Arrange matches between top 16 ranked teams in the four year period between the world cups so that the associates can make themselves competitive before the world cup and hence less one sided matches in the world cup. 4 ) ICC should also look into teams like UAE,Hongkong,Canada,USA etc. , where almost all the players are expats.There should be a limit on the total number of expat players in the playing XI because if cricket is to grow in a country then local people should be picked in the national team. 5 ) Format and length of the world cup . In my view the best format would be 16 or 20 teams in four groups.Best two teams in the group go to the knock out stages.In this way we can have either 31 matches ( 16 team world cup ) or 47 matches ( 20 team world cup ) . BRUTALANALYST on April 9 , 2015 , 13 : 35 GMT I also think the ODI world cup should trim a couple of the associates but still allow for best 2 ( hopefully next time there wont be this associate tag just names ) however for the T20 world cup they should all be involved in fact maybe a few more could even be added . BRUTALANALYST on April 9 , 2015 , 13 : 32 GMT International cricket is a mess right now and whilst I do n't think Ireland are ready to play Tests not helped by England taking their main bowler but there should be a points and table system maybe 2 divisions so International games have relevence and sides like Ireland have chance of being promoted to div 1 no this constant top 8 System. Also they should play 4day warm ups against Englands touring sides not just Odis and must have fixtures v Australia India WI A teams around the year to get experience in different conditions and constant 4day cricket . StevieS on April 9 , 2015 , 13 : 30 GMT Shantanu a very scientific poll , if it was the eqact same formular played in India with them winning it I bet everything I own that it would n't be voted most boring ! As a NZ fan I found this one to be the best ever . StevieS on April 9 , 2015 , 13 : 27 GMT They should have regular games with WI , Pakistan and Bangladesh , teams of equal level . Sathish8201 on April 9 , 2015 , 13 : 19 GMT @ SALEEL PRADAN - I also voted for 2007 world cup not only because India got knocked out in group stages but because of super eights stage which made the tournament lengthy and boring.I think people voted for 2015 not just because of associate teams but because of multiple reasons.One reason is the format which made the tournament lengthy.Second is a lot of one sided matches.For one sided matches every team involved in that match has to take blame because there are lot of one sided matches between full member nations also.For eg. , SL vs SA , SL vs Eng , NZ vs Eng , SA vs WI , WI vs PAK , IND vs Pak etc.,Then why only blame associate teams for one sided matches. So these reasons can not be used against associate teams for their place in future world cups . on April 9 , 2015 , 12 : 33 GMT For those calling 2015 world cup boring , it was not boring due to associates. Ireland were the ones who made the group stages interesting. The world cup was boring due to a imbalance between bat & ball. There should have been more scores in the 200-300 range , and very few over 300. This world cup has lots of matches where the team batting 1st made 300 + and the team chasing lost by big margins. It would have been equally boring with the same playing conditions , whether we had 10 teams or 20 teams world cup The ODI rules need to be changed and also more associates included. 16-20 is the right number for world cups. The fans of 10 team " world " cup can watch the champions trophy instead on April 9 , 2015 , 12 : 10 GMT Pakistan did offer them a tour they backed out,they are welcome again on April 9 , 2015 , 11 : 55 GMT @ SHANTANU - I completely agree with your response. I was surprised to see that result because I voted for the 2007 World Cup maybe because I was biased towards India getting knocked out sadly , but it was surprising to see people voting for 2015 where India reached the semi-finals handsomely. So , that truly says A LOT about how people feel about a boring long 14-team event. Just way too many pointless matches ! You can almost be innovative and creative with a 10-team format . on April 9 , 2015 , 11 : 42 GMT Here is the way I see it. Do we like football ? Yes. Do we like 32 teams ? Yes. If they include India wouldnt we all fill up stadiums like Ireland is talking about in this article ? Yes. Does that mean FIFA gives India a freebie ? NO. I do agree that Ireland has improved immensely and it is puzzling why England can not have series ' setup against them. I personally think England is intimidated by Ireland and does not want them to grow. On the other hand , BCCI has done well to help develop Bangladesh and backed them with series ' against India over the years making them a strong unit today. Today Ireland is talking a big game , tomorrow Nepal and Fiji will want the same. A 14-team world cup is just as exclusive as a 10-team world cup. Just adding 4 more nations does not satisfy Nepal , Namibia , Canada , USA , UAE , Kenya , Ireland , Scotland , Netherlands , Denmark , etc. Ireland is only crying about it because they see themself within the top 14 , and careless for the remaining. Keep it to 10. Please ! on April 9 , 2015 , 11 : 00 GMT @ EDD OLIVER There was a poll few days ago about " which was the most boring wc ever " and maximum votes was given to 2015 which indeed was a 14 team wc. So you want another 14 team wc in 2019 to make it even more boring. ICC knows what they are doing lets 10 team play against each other in round robin it will be a success for sure . nzcricket174 on April 9 , 2015 , 10 : 48 GMT Best format : top 8 sides qualify for main leg of tournament , with however many other sides having to qualify. This means you can continually expand the no. of teams there are . on April 9 , 2015 , 10 : 10 GMT Keep 14 teams for all WCs.But ICC should consider having the associates play with A teams of all test nations.The 2nd teams of all countries are equally good.This will help in their development and schedules of major teams wo n't be affected.This way they can play test matches also.So,in the next WCs teams like Ireland,Scotland can make matches contesting.This is the only way to help them develop by giving them more match practice . John-Price on April 9 , 2015 , 10 : 00 GMT @ FIGHTCLUB_99 Fixtures against top ten countries would n't have made the slightest difference to Kenya. The base was n't strong enough . ilovetests on April 9 , 2015 , 9 : 50 GMT Both NZ and Australia are touring England in a few months. Rather than playing meaningless 5 or 7 match odi series and warm-ups against county sides that will probably rest their best players , surely there is a place for some matches against Ireland and Scotland ! on April 9 , 2015 , 9 : 40 GMT As said many times on here over the past 2 months , the 10 team World Cup in 2019 is an incredibly short-sighted and ultimately self-defeating move by the ICC. Why have n't Cricinfo run a poll on their front page about fans ' preferred number of teams for the 2019 World Cup ? Just give us the option of 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , or more than 16 , and let 's see the results ! When it shows that hardly anyone is in favour of a 10 team WC then it will show the ICC how unpopular their proposal is , even more than the 23,000 that signed the petition on change.org . ygkd on April 9 , 2015 , 8 : 43 GMT Recommended correction to headline : Ireland are crying out for games against OTHER top teams . Poplavar on April 9 , 2015 , 8 : 12 GMT The ten team format is an utter disgrace .. . Following that logic Australia and England would still only be playing each other .. . Without encouragement the game would be without names like Richards , Sangakara , Tendulkar , Hadlee..to name a few of the very elite that came from countries that once upon a time were regarded as weak and inferior ... . One can only ask what interests are being served ....cos it certainly ai n't crickets ! ! FiGhtCluB_99 on April 9 , 2015 , 8 : 06 GMT Remember how Kenya took the 2003 WC by storm , and how everyone was talking about Kenya becoming one of the top teams in 5-10 years. What happened after that WC ? Nothing. Kenya just faded away because they got no opportunity to play against any top team. And the ICC has n't learned from that mistake. Ireland is not a new face in cricket , they have had a cricketing tradition from several decades ago. So it does n't really require the ICC to popularise cricket in Ireland. Just give them 20 ODIs per year against top sides and you 'll have a Test quality team by 2020 . mihir_nam on April 9 , 2015 , 7 : 48 GMT Only Option is Ireland Bargain hard for Full Membership soon and try to get it till 2016 atleast. . on April 9 , 2015 , 7 : 18 GMT ICC is the bully with no competition. All the associates and affiliates should start a new World Cricket Association like fifa and I guarantee you the likes of Pakistan , Srilanka and South Africa will soon join them because of their treatment by the so called big 3. Then you will who has what it takes to be the no 1. Australia ? I doubt it... . on April 9 , 2015 , 7 : 04 GMT I have very little doubt that Ireland is 2nd/3rd favorite team of any cricket follower from India or any other top-10 nation. And along with Ireland , Afghanistan and Holland are putting up really good show too. I see very good chances , that in next 3-4 years they will be CONSISTENTLY beating the likes of Ind , Aus , SA , Eng in atleast 3/10 matches . on April 9 , 2015 , 7 : 03 GMT Looking at the debacle of a warm-up game in the West Indies at the moment , and bearing in mind how during previous Ashes warm ups there seems to be a policy of weakened teams in warm-up games , should this not be a chance for Associate teams to get involved ? on April 9 , 2015 , 6 : 52 GMT atleast give 3 spot after top 8 make 11 team world cup , odi cricket will be more competitive , and everyone would be wanted to be in top 8 than on April 9 , 2015 , 5 : 29 GMT Ireland is a great team who have proven their worth in the last 3 world cups. I think they should be given more opportunity to play against big names . on April 9 , 2015 , 5 : 22 GMT Atleast 16 teams have to be there in 2019 world cup. We can have 4 groups of 4 , double round robin like 1983 and then the knockouts. Total of 55 matches and the world cup can be finished in about 5 weeks with 2 matches in a day. Another format can be 2 groups of 8 , which makes it 63 matches and world cup about 38-40 days long with 2 matches in a day and gives all teams 7 matches and chances against more teams Ireland , Scotland & Netherlands will be very competitive in conditions similar to home in England and all of them can get stadiums atleast 60-70 % full with their fans. And everyone knows about the passionate support Afghanistan & Nepal have. The UK & Europe based Afghans & Nepalis will surely go the stadiums to watch their teams play Cricket needs to be globalised.
