World Cup 2015 : England can still make last eight , says Morgan The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Mar 1 , 2015 , 02.24PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 WELLINGTON : England captain Eoin Morgan insisted he was still confident of reaching the World Cup quarter-finals , despite Sunday 's " hard to take " nine-wicket loss against Sri Lanka . The defeat leaves England on the brink of an early exit after heavy losses to New Zealand and Australia in their opening matches . England 's final Pool A matches against Bangladesh and Afghanistan now loom as must-win clashes but Morgan said he had not considered failing to make the last eight . " It 's not even a thought at the moment -- two games to win to get us into the quarter-final , " he said . Morgan said the fact that England set a competitive 310-run target made the Sri Lanka loss more difficult to accept than the routs against Australia and New Zealand , when they were never in the game . " When you do n't turn up for a race like those first two games , it 's scratch. But today , when we turn up and we 're beaten in that fashion it 's harder to take. " Morgan said England performed with the bat , particularly Joe Root who made 121 , but failed with the ball to allow Sri Lanka to finish on 312-1 . " When we bowl one bad ball , every couple of overs or every over you 're going to be punished , " he said . Morgan said England remained a quality side that needed to work on " the simple things " to click at the tournament . " It 's not out of our reach or a million miles away , " he said. " It 's just continuing to reproduce the simple things consistently. " Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
