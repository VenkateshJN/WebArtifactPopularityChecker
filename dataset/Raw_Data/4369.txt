( Reuters Photo ) Page 1 of 4 BRISBANE : Fast bowler Steven Finn claimed his first five-wicket haul in a One Day International as England destroyed India 's batting lineup at the Gabba in Brisbane on Tuesday . Finn took 5-33 from eight overs while Jimmy Anderson picked up four wickets as the pair skittled the reigning world champions for just 153 in less than 40 overs . The towering Finn , who stands 2.01 metres ( 6ft 7in ) tall , tore through the fragile Indian middle order with his pace and extra bounce , with three of his wickets coming through catches to wicketkeeper Jos Buttler . Finn got the prized wickets of Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni and was on a hat-trick after he clean bowled Axar Patel , who made his second golden duck of the tri-series , which also involves Australia . Anderson gave England the perfect start when he removed Shikhar Dhawan for one in the third over and returned to mop up the tail and finish with 4-18 in a timely boost to England 's World Cup preparations . With India 's world record holder Rohit Sharma skipping the match because of a minor hamstring complaint after cracking a century in the loss to Australia on Sunday , the tourists needed someone else to make a big contribution but no-one did . All-rounder Stuart Binny , who came in for Ravichandran Ashwin , top scored for India with 44 off 55 balls , featuring two sixes , while Dhoni made a patient 34 and opener Ajinkya Rahane 33 after replacing Sharma .
