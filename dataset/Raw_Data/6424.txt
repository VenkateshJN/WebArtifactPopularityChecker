Loading comments jackiethepen on March 11 , 2015 , 0 : 11 GMT Gloom and doom from George. He does overdo the dark side. The worse ever ? There have been some rants about t20 and why do we pick Test players instead of t20 etc ! ! But these ARE our t20 players. I would bet George picked every one of them. Hales , Ali , Root , Morgan , Bopara , Taylor , Buttler , Broad , Finn , Woakes , Tredwell , Jordan , are our t20 international squad. Only Ballance and Bell are not. Morgan got a match winning knock for t20 in the summer against India and won the game. So all this talk about not picking t20 experts is just nonsense. They were selected for their attacking play. Bell was selected to give balance. He provided the runs , more than any other player , they did n't provide the big hitting. Think about that George. Holland did beat many in this team in the t20 world cup. But nobody was screaming about that. Giles was sacked . RohanMarkJay on March 10 , 2015 , 9 : 40 GMT I think there have been one or two which were worse , especially during the late 1990s though it was n't in world cups but in terms of overall history. Since the world cup started 40 years ago. I agree this is the worst the absolute lowpoint of English cricket in ODI format. Remember England upto 1992 World Cup were able to constantly reached the Semi-final or final of World Cup tournaments. Since 1992 the fall of English cricket in ODI is dramatic. With yesterdays result being the lowest point. They have n't adapted since 20-20 came along. They are way behind other nations in this format . prakash_mishra on March 10 , 2015 , 9 : 25 GMT This English show was looming for quite some time , though they managed to save their faces somehow since 1992 WC finals. In the two editions ( 1999 WC and 2003 WC ) , where only three teams qualified from the group stages , they never once managed to make it to the next round. Their 2011 campaign was also in tatters , where they lost to Ireland and Bangladesh , but managed to beat South Africa , West Indies and tie with India. In a way , England posted their best world cup display in 2011 since 1992. This time , they did show some promise by beating India twice in the tri-series , but that seems already like a distant memory. Now with a loss each to SL , BD , Aus and NL , they do not deserve to go anywhere , but back home on March 10 , 2015 , 1 : 54 GMT @ Gavin7094 it does n't matter that they lost to teams that had a good chance of beating them anyway , it 's that they lost to EVERY team that had a chance of beating them. Play a 5 match series against NZ or Australia you 'd expect them to lose 4 out of 5 , but you 'd expect them to get it together for one day at least and pull off a win , but they did n't. Not once in this tournament did they really come together as a team and manage a " good " performance . mondotv on March 9 , 2015 , 23 : 12 GMT Very telling comment from George - fearful or full of fear describes the English performance to a tee. First of all you insert the opposition in Adelaide when you win the toss. That 's a move motivated by fear - fear that the batting wo n't do well and set a decent target. And hope that Bangladesh will just collapse in a heap. Did n't happen and suddenly you 've put that suspect batting line up under all kinds of pressure. Pressure that should have been on the opposition . Deuce03 on March 9 , 2015 , 20 : 51 GMT Let 's not go too crazy here. Was this worse than the 1999 world cup ? The loss to New Zealand that saw them propping up the Test rankings ? The 1988-9 fiasco ? Managing to come third in a bilateral competition in 1995 ? England have been used to a period of fairly consistent success with the occasional aberration for the last twelve years or so , everywhere except World Cups , at least. For those with longer memories , the current embarrassments still fail to plumb the same depths as any number of incidents from the Dark Years . on March 9 , 2015 , 20 : 02 GMT Wow george dem eyes at the end IndiaNumeroUno on March 9 , 2015 , 19 : 51 GMT No.. its not the worst... the worst has yet to come. . Watch out next for a thrashing by the mighty Afghans : ) ) ! ! paddingupchris on March 9 , 2015 , 17 : 17 GMT It was n't their worst performance ever but in terms of what was riding on it it was close on March 9 , 2015 , 16 : 58 GMT I think there loss to the Netherlands was worse wasnt it ?
