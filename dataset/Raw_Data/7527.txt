West Indies v England at Port of Spain , Feb 11-16 , 1948 scorecard Test statistics 1940/41 - 1962/63 Profile In one respect Andy Ganteaume , a diminutive wicketkeeper-batsman , eclipsed even Don Bradman. Whereas Bradman ended his career with a Test average of 99.94 , Gunteaume 's was 112. On his Test debut , against England at Port-of-Spain in 1947-48 , he scored 112 and yet he never played for West Indies again. West Indies had a formidable batting line-up around this time - it was the era of Walcott , Worrell , Weekes , Sobers , Kanhai , Rae , Stollmeyer and Gomez - and there were suggestions that he slowed down when nearing his hundred , possibly costing West Indies the chance of victory. Jeff Stollmeyer later wrote : " Andy 's innings in its later stages was not in keeping with the state of the game and his captain [ Gerry Gomez ] was forced to send a message out to him to 'get on with it'. " Stollmeyer did concede that Ganteaume was unlucky to miss out on selection for the tour of India the following year. Ganteaume continued to play for Trinidad , and in fact toured England as late as 1957 without getting into the Test side . Steven Lynch
