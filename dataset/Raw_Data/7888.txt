This week , we take a look at the 10 men who have been named Man of the Match in a World Cup final. Who will be turning this 10 into XI in two months ’ time at the MCG ? Join the conversation using # cwc15 and let us know . 1975 : Clive Lloyd , West Indies ( 102 runs ) It was the first World Cup and the one-day format was a relatively new concept . The World ’ s two strongest teams – West Indies and Australia – advanced to the final , with West Indies starting the favourite having beaten Australia by seven wickets during the group stage . Sent in to bat , West Indies were soon struggling at 50 for 3 . Clive Lloyd changed that . Lloyd gave an exhibition of explosive hitting , scoring 102 runs in a knock that included 12 fours and two sixes , helping set Australia a target of 292. Most impressively it was scored at a staggering rate for the time , off just 85 balls to change the course of the final . Australia fell 18 runs short from the target , handing West Indies the inaugural World Cup . 1979 : Viv Richards , West Indies ( 138 * ) In the second Cricket World Cup final , defending champions West Indies were up against England at Lord ’ s . England won the toss and sent West Indies into bat. Disaster quickly struck for the defending champions , who lost the wickets of Gordon Greenidge , Desmond Haynes , Alvin Kallicharan and Clive Lloyd to be in serious trouble at 4-99 . That was before Viv Richards steadied the ship , scoring 138 from 157 balls and combining with Collis King ( 86 runs ) to help their team to an imposing total of 286 . England started well in reply but it all fell apart for the host nation when they lost 8-11 , losing by 92 runs . 1983 : Mohinder Amarnath , India ( 3-12 and 26 runs ) West Indies were aiming for a third consecutive Cricket World Cup when they took on India at Lord ’ s . Sent in to bat , India struggled against the powerful West Indies bowling attack and were dismissed for 183 , with only Mohinder Amarnath ( 26 ) and Kris Srikkanth ( 38 ) in the runs . West Indies looked destined for victory , but the game turned on its head when the India bowling attack took advantage of the pitch and weather conditions to tear through the defending champion ’ s batsmen , dismissing them for 140 . Amarnath ( 3-12 ) and Madan Lal ( 3 – 31 ) each took three wickets , with the former ’ s combined performance with both bat and ball earning him the man-of-the-match title . 1987 : David Boon , Australia ( 75 runs ) More than 70,000 people packed into Eden Gardens for the final of the 1987 World Cup. India had been knocked out of the tournament by England in the semi-final a few days earlier and as a result , the crowd was heartily backing Australia in the big dance . David Boon had headed into the match in good form having scored 372 runs in seven matches prior to the final . Opening the batting alongside Geoff Marsh , Boon scored 75 runs and combined in two significant partnerships with Marsh and Dean Jones to set the tone for the Australian innings . Australia finished at 5-253 and England , despite a good start , was unable to reach the total , finishing seven runs short . 1992 : Wasim Akram , Pakistan ( 33 and 3-49 ) England hoped to make up for the heartbreak of losing the 1987 final when they met Pakistan at the MCG in 1992 . They also headed in favourites , having bowled Pakistan out for 74 earlier in the tournament . The final started in a similar fashion when Derek Pringle dismissed both Pakistani openers at 24 , but Pakistan recovered to score 6-249 and Khan top-scored with 72 . Javed Miandad scored 58 , while Inzamam-ul-Haq ( 42 ) and Wasim Akram ( 33 ) also chipped in . Ian Botham was then dismissed for a duck by Wasim Akram , who also snared two other wickets as England was dismissed for 227 . Akram finished with 3-49 and was rightly named man of the match . 1996 : Aravinda de Silva , Sri Lanka ( 107 * and 3-42 ) For the first time , the World Cup final was placed at Gaddafi Stadium in Pakistan and more than 62,000 people turned out to watch Sri Lanka play favourites Australia . Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga won the toss and sent Australia in to bat . Captain Mark Taylor and Ricky Ponting ensured a solid start for the Aussies , but the 1987 champions fell apart when the pair was dismissed , falling to 5 – 170 . Australia finished with 7 – 241 and Sri Lanka looked in trouble early after losing both openers . That was before Aravinda De Silva changed everything as he scored a match-winning 107 * , supported by Asanka Gurusingha ( 65 ) and Ranatunga ( 47 not out ) , as Sri Lanka won by seven wickets . 1999 : Shane Warne , Australia ( 4-33 ) The World Cup final returned to Lord ’ s in 1999 and Australia was aiming to make amends for 1996 when they played Pakistan . Pakistan won the toss and batted but that was as good as the news got for them that day. No batsman scored above 25 as Pakistan was dismissed for 132 , with Shane Warne capturing a match-winning 4-33 . Australia ’ s top order saw them team over the line in 20.1 overs , with Adam Gilchrist top scoring with 54 . 2003 : Ricky Ponting ( 140 * ) A second-straight World Cup title was on the line when Australia met India at Wanderers Stadium in 2003 . India sent Australia in to bat and the defending champions got off to a flying start , with Adam Gilchrist scoring 57 from 48 balls . Captain Ricky Ponting was the standout , with 140 from 121 balls , and Damien Martyn ( 88 ) provided valuable support as Australia scored a massive 359 . India 's run chase faltered in the first over when Sachin Tendulkar was caught out , and they never recovered , bowled out for 234 , giving Australia an emphatic 125-run victory . 2007 : Adam Gilchrist ( 149 runs ) It was 2007 , the scene was Barbados , and Australia were aiming to win their third straight World Cup . Rain shortened the match to 38 overs per side and batting first Australia needed a strong start from openers Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden . The two batting legends provided , with Gilchrist smashing a memorable 149 off 104 balls in a 172-run partnership . Gilchrist took just 72 balls to reach his century and Australia finished on 4-281 . That target was reduced to 269 off 36 overs after further rain , but Sri Lanka was unable to chase down the Australian score , finishing on 8-215 to hand Australia a 53-run win and a third-successive World Cup trophy . Gilchrist ’ s knock rightly went down as one of the best of his 287-match ODI career . 2011 : MS Dhoni ( 91 * ) India went into the 2011 final looking to break a 28-year World Cup draught , while Sri Lanka hoped to make amends for losing the 2007 final . In front of a packed Wankhede Stadium with billions watching , Sri Lanka had the better start , winning the toss and batting . Sri Lanka scored 6-274 thanks to a century from Mahela Jayawardene and when India opener Virender Sehwag fell for a duck , India appeared to be in trouble . Their position was not much better at 4-113 after Virat Kohli was caught , but that was before a determined MS Dhoni strode to the crease . The skipper started in a sedate fashion , without a boundary in his first 10 overs at the crease , but stepped up when the equation become 27 runs required from 24 balls . Three Dhoni boundaries slashed the deficit to five runs from 12 balls and in a fairy-tale finish , the captain smashed a six to seal the championship . Share this article :
