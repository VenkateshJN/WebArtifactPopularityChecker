Asked about the crowd support after India 's 130-win over South Africa , Dhoni said , " Well , I 'm glad somebody asked that question because the attendance was close to 86,000 or 87,000. Let 's give the benefit of doubt , 20,000 to the South African fans ( everyone started laughing ) , but to get like over 50,000 people in Australia , I think it just adds on to atmosphere that gets created. It starts from the warm-up , and after the National Anthem , it just multiplies. " " It 's always good to play in front of good support , and the kind of support we are talking about , even when we are playing in India , there are stadiums , some of the stadiums which do n't have that kind of capacity , so even when they are full they 're close to 40,000 , so today we are seeing in Australia close to more than 50,000 to 60,000 people supporting us , " Dhoni said , profusely thanking the fans for their unmatched support . " Definitely we need to give a lot of credit to them , so I think it 's really heartening to see people coming from all over , not only India , a lot of them are from Australia , from England they have come. All of it feels good to play in front of big crowds , " the skipper said . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
