World Cup 2015 : India least fancied to win by bookies The author has posted comments on this article Shailendra Awasthi , TNN | Mar 24 , 2015 , 09.13AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 MUMBAI : Cricket experts may be calling the World Cup semifinal contest between India and Australia a close one but bookies are certain that Australia will prevail over India . Australia is hot favourite to win the Sydney contest with bookies offering 50/100 ( 50 paisa for a rupee ) on the hosts while India are pegged at 21 ( two rupees for a rupee ) . In the other last-four clash between South Africa and New Zealand , bookies are not very sure , which reflects in the odds on offer. For a South African win , bookies are offering 75/100 while New Zealand is not too far with 130/100 ( one rupee and 30 paisa for a rupee ) . As for the title itself , Australia are clear favourites. Bookies are offering 140/100 for the co-hosts winning again. South Africa are second favourites at 325/100. New Zealand are next favourites for the championship at 41 while and India are last among the four semifinalists at 51 . Due to illegal nature of transactions in the country , Indian bookies only accept bets for win or loss or for 'session ' bets in a given match. Session bets are accepted for predictions on possible runs scored in a session of 10 overs each with a margin of 15 to 20 runs more or less . The English markets say Australian opener David Warner is most likely to be Man of the Match in the semis with odds offered at 81 while from the Indian side , Virat Kohli is most likely to be the best player at 101 . According to sources , more than Rs 5000 crore is being wagered on the two semifinals . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
