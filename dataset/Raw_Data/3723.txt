( Reuters Photo ) Page 1 of 4 MANCHESTER : Ian Bell chose to rub it in as England launched their preparation for the fourth Test against India after five days of rest and recreation . Bell , one of the few senior pros in the side , felt apart from the James Anderson-Ravindra Jadeja incident , nothing has been said on the field and the series has been played in the right spirit . " A lot has been made about that issue. I can only say from what I have been a part of -there has been very little said on the field , " Bell said at Old Trafford on Tuesday . Asked to comment on the possibility of the judicial commissioner 's verdict going into appeal , Bell said : " Just heard that now. However , from Jimmy 's point of view , the last couple of weeks were tough , yet he managed to put it aside and won the Man of the Match award in Southampton. We would rather focus on a good series rather than talk about one incident that got blown out of proportion.
