England put up 247-6 in 39 overs , giving Sri Lanka a tough target of 259 to win on the Duckworth/Lewis method . Gary Ballance and Ian Bell scored half centuries after Alastair Cook was out for 11 , but Bell 's departure on 50 marked the start of a heavy shower which stalled the match for 2 { hours . Ballance returned to score 64 , Joe Root hit 45 , but Jordan and Buttler gave England a huge boost as they smashed death bowlers Nuwan Kulasekara and Lasith Malinga for 27 runs each in the last four overs . Sachithra Senanayake was the pick of the bowlers with 3-30 . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
