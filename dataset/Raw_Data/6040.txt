25th December 1984 Alastair Cook is born On this day in 1984 , Alastair Cook , future England Test captain was born. Alastair Cook made his Test debut in Nagpur , India and straight away hit the ground running. He scored 60 and 104 * on debut , negotiating Test match stalwarts Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh with an assured technique and truck loads of patience . Cook went from strength to strength thereafter and six years later became England 's highest century maker in Test history when he scored his 23rd Test century against India at the Eden Gardens . In between , in 2011-12 , he scored a sensational 766 runs in seven innings to give England their first series win in Australia after 24 years. After Andrew Strauss retired in 2012 , Cook took over England captaincy and instantly won a Test series in India . His record in the shorter format of the game is n't much to write home about but he was handed over captaincy to oversee England 's transition period post World Cup 2011. However , bad form and poor results in the 2013-14 lead to his expulsion from the 2015 World Cup squad , a tournament he has never played in ! But , expect him to come back strong when England gear up for their next battle in whites . Â© Cricbuzz
