Â© AP Dubai : Star Pakistan off-spinner Saeed Ajmal was cleared to resume international cricket after his bowling action was found to be legal during a retest at an ICC-accredited facility in Chennai , a development which may open up a chance for him to play in the upcoming World Cup. ( Complete coverage of the World Cup ) The ICC confirmed in a release that following remedial work and retests , the bowling actions of Ajmal and Sohag Gazi of Bangladesh have been found to be legal , and the players can now resume bowling in international cricket . The 37-year-old Ajmal was suspended from bowling in international cricket last September for illegal bowling action . He failed the first test conducted in Brisbane last year and then underwent a retest on January 24 at Sri Ramachandra University Sports Medicine Centre in Chennai where it was found that his bowling actions for all of his deliveries were within the 15-degree level of tolerance permitted under the ICC rules . " At the retests , it was revealed that the amount of elbow extensions in both the off-spinners ' bowling actions for all their deliveries was within the 15-degree level of tolerance permitted under the ICC regulations for the review of bowlers reported with suspected illegal bowling actions , " the ICC said in the release . " In advance of any retest , a player who has been banned from bowling in international cricket , is required to identify the various types of deliveries he wants assessed , with a view to bowling those types of deliveries in international cricket should they be tested as legal , " it said . Ajmal had opted out of the Pakistan team for the World Cup beginning February 14 in Australia and New Zealand because of suspect bowling action , but since he has been cleared it remains to be seen whether he can be included in the squad or not. A team can ask for a replacement for an injured player in the squad and an ICC Committee will take a call on that . Ajmal was reported after the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle in August last , while Gazi was also reported in August after the second One-Day International against the West Indies in Grenada . Both Ajmal and Gazi failed the initial tests , which were performed on August 25 at National Cricket Centre in Brisbane , and on September 19 at the Cardiff Metropolitan University , respectively . The ICC said that umpires were still at liberty to report Ajmal and Gazi in the future if they believe they are having suspect actions . " To assist the umpires they have been provided with images and video footage of the two bowlers ' significantly remodelled legal bowling actions , " the ICC said .
