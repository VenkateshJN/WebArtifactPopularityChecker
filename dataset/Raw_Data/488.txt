Mohammad Shami is seen during the training session . Shami has claimed nine wickets from the two matches he has played in . The pitch in Sydney is not expected to assist pacers much. Dhawal Kulkarni then , may not get to play in the final contest but that did not stop him from coming out for the session . Ishant Sharma though would be sure to find a place in the playing XI . The lanky pacer has nine wickets from three matches so far . The team will be under Virat Kohli who is seen swinging a stick here . Kohli also obliged waiting fans by signing their autograph books . Fans also took selfies with Kohli and the 26-year-old graciously obliged . Opener Shikhar Dhawan too was seen getting himself clicked with supporters . It would be interesting to see if Dhawan plays in Sydney. Although there has been no report of him being dropped , he may be rested if India decide to play two spinners . Leave a comment
