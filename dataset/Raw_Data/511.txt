Â© AFP Shakib Al Hasan and Tamim Iqbal scored centuries as Bangladesh took charge of the second Test against Zimbabwe in Khulna on Tuesday. ( Scorecard ) The hosts , who plodded to 193-3 on the opening day after electing to bat , made 433 in their first innings before being dismissed in the final session of the second day . Zimbabwe ended the day on 53-1 , still trailing by 380 runs with nine wickets in hand , after left-arm spinner Taijul Islam trapped Sikandar Raza leg-before for 11 . Hamilton Masakadza was unbeaten on 15 and Brian Chari was on 21 when stumps were drawn . Bangladesh lead the three-match series 1-0 after winning the first Test in Dhaka by three wickets . The left-handed pair of Tamim and Shakib put Bangladesh on top with a fourth-wicket stand of 132 on a slow pitch . Shakib made 137 , his third Test century , with the help of 18 boundaries and two sixes . Tamim scored a painstaking 109 , his fifth Test hundred and the first in four years , with 10 fours . When Tamim reached 100 off 312 balls , he recorded the slowest Test century by a Bangladeshi batsman -- surpassing his elder brother Nafees Iqbal , who needed 309 deliveries to reach a hundred against the same opponents in 2005 . Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim played 31 consecutive dot balls before he was run out for 11 , but Shakib broke free to reach his century with a straight drive off Tinashe Panyangara . Tamim fell to part-timer Masakadza , before Malcolm Waller dismissed Shakib and Shuvagata Hom ( 15 ) to ease the pressure on Zimbabwe . Taijul hit a quick-fire 32 off 44 balls to carry Bangladesh past the 400-run mark . Tendai Chatara got rid of Taijul and Shahadat Hossain , before Natsai M'shangwe wrapped up the innings by claiming Jubair Hossain leg-before to earn his maiden Test wicket . The third Test between the two lowest-ranked teams -- Zimbabwe at number nine and Bangladesh at 10 -- will be played in Chittagong from November 12-16 . The Tests will be followed by five one-day internationals .
