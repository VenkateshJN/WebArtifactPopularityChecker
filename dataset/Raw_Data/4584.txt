World Cup 2015 : Finch looks to thrive again at Melbourne The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Mar 27 , 2015 , 03.22PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 MELBOURNE : Australian opener Aaron Finch believes his 81 in the World Cup semifinal win over India could spur him on to a match-winning innings in Sunday 's final against New Zealand at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . The vast MCG arena is a place where the 28-year-old has enjoyed considerable success and has allowed him to boast an impressive average of 65.16 . " It 's a place I love playing. I 've had a fair bit of success there with both Australia and Victoria , " said Finch . " The wicket 's always good , fast outfield and a big ground. " Finch 's runs against India were a welcome boost for a man who had been in something of a mini-slump since his 135 against England in Melbourne in the tournament opener on February 14 . Skipper Michael Clarke expects Finch to fire on all cylinders on Sunday . " Do n't be surprised if he walks out on Sunday and makes an unbelievable hundred , " Clarke said . " That innings against India on Thursday will do him a world of good. He was a little bit disappointed with the way he batted ... but that time in the middle will allow him on Sunday to walk out and play with freedom.
