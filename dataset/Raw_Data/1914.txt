Chennai Super Kings , Rajasthan Royals meet in marquee clash K Shriniwas Rao K Shriniwas Rao,TNN | Apr 23 , 2014 , 10.30 AM IST Dhoni 's men will not be up against any ordinary side this time. ( TOI Photo ) RELATED SHARJAH : A controversy-free start to the seventh edition of the IPL in the UAE has ensured that the air of discomfort which had enveloped the two troubled franchises , Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals has disappeared . With both teams having played two matches each already , the focus is now back on cricket rather than the off the-field drama that had surrounded the two teams . The Chennai Super Kings registered a spectacularly one-sided win against the Delhi Daredevils in Abu Dhabi on Monday while the Rajasthan Royals lost a well-fought game against the Kings XI Punjab in Sharjah on Saturday. Having won and lost a match each , both teams are sailing in the same boat . The Super Kings are left without the services of all-rounder Dwayne Bravo , who has been ruled out for 'three to four weeks ' and is most likely to miss out on the entire tournament now. The Royals , though have no such worries with skipper Shane Watson most likely to retain the side that played the other day . CSK will head into the game riding on a huge wave of confidence as they put in an inspired fielding performance against Delhi. MS Dhoni 's men , however , will not be up against any ordinary side this time. The Rajasthan Royals are one of the best bought teams at the auction this year . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Shane Watson,Rajasthan Royals,MS Dhoni,IPL,Chennai Super Kings Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
