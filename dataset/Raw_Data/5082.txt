ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 ( Full Coverage ) Super Over in World Cup final in case of tie Dubai , 2015/Jan/29 01 : 53 : 00 Text Size A Super Over will be played in the final of the 2015 World Cup in case of a tie. © Getty The International Cricket Council ( ICC ) has announced changes to the playing conditions in the 2015 Cricket World Cup in their first meeting of the year at the ICC headquarters in Dubai on Thursday. The most important development that came out of the meeting is that there will be a Super Over in case of a tie in the final. The previous scenario was that the trophy would be shared in case of a tie . The ICC also approved a change in the Code of Conduct in offences relating to slow over-rates. The change states that captains do not carry any prior minor over-rate offence 'strikes ' or over-rate suspensions from other series into an ICC event. This approval means all captains will enter the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 with no over-rate strikes against their names , and they will only be suspended from playing in a World Cup match if over-rate offences are committed during the event . The ICC also gave the schedule for all the major events from 2015 to 2019. India will be hosting the 2016 T20 WC from March 11 to April 03 while the Champions Trophy will once again be held in England from June 01 to June 19 , 2017. India will be hosting the T20 WC for the first time. England will also be the venue for the 2019 World Cup and it will be held from May 31 to July 15 . The ICC and the Pakistan Cricket Board have also approved Mohammad Amir 's return to domestic cricket. Amir was banned in September 2010 for five years after he was found guilty of spot-fixing. His ban was supposed to end on September 02 , 2015 but the ACSU ( Anti Corrution and Security Unit ) on the recommendation of chairman Sir Ronnie Flanaghan , reduced Amir 's ban by eight months as he had co-operated with the ACSU . According to article 6.8 of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code , " The chairman of the ACSU shall , only after obtaining the prior written agreement of any relevant National Cricket Federation ( s ) and the prior approval of the ICC Board , have discretion to permit a participant who is subject to a period of ineligibility to participate or otherwise be involved in domestic matches at any time prior to the end of that period.
