Fudadin , 29 , from Guyana , has played three Tests in 2012 against England and New Zealand .

The West Indies Cricket Board has since set up a task force to explore the controversy with a report due on December 18 . West Indies will play three Tests , three Twenty20 internationals and five one-dayers in South Africa .
