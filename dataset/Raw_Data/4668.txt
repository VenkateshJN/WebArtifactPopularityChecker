" I do n't think it 's a major concern , " said Waqar after the match. " He has an issue with his gluteus and it 's an old problem . " Irfan will be fine in the next couple of days and will play against South Africa. " Irfan , the tallest ever cricketer at 7 feet , one inch , managed to bowl just three overs and hurt his hip in the field on Wednesday . The 32-year-old paceman has taken six wickets in the tournament with a best of 4/30 against Zimbabwe in Brisbane on Sunday . He will be key in Pakistan 's crunch game against South Africa in Auckland on Saturday . Pakistan have four points in as many games and need to win their next two games -- the last against Ireland in Adelaide on March 15 .
