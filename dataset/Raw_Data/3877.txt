Kevin Pietersen 'not on England radar ' , says Moores The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Apr 2 , 2015 , 02.58PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 LONDON : Kevin Pietersen " is n't on the radar " for an England recall , coach Peter Moores told reporters on Thursday as his squad prepared to fly out to the West Indies . Incoming England and Wales Cricket Board ( ECB ) chairman Colin Graves has suggested that Pietersen may yet be able to resurrect his England career , having been frozen out of the national set-up a year ago . The South Africa-born batsman agreed a return to Surrey last week in a bid to enhance his chances of a recall , but Moores says that his entire focus is on the three-Test series in the Caribbean . " For me , Kevin 's not on this trip , so I do n't need to focus on Kevin at all , " Moores told a media conference at Gatwick Airport . " My focus is to support ( captain ) Alastair ( Cook ) as I always would and the 16 players on this tour . " At the end of that summer ( 2014 ) we 'd gone through a tough summer , and started to play the sort of attacking cricket people like , and we like. That 's our focus at the moment . " From my point of view , Kevin is n't on the radar. So he ca n't be in my or Cooky 's focus at all. " Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
