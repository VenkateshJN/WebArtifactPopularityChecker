Shikhar Dhawan 's form opens a debate The author has posted comments on this article TNN & Agencies | Jan 4 , 2015 , 08.52AM IST Shikhar Dhawan heads back to the dressing room after being given out during their play on the fourth day of the second Test against Australia in Brisbane. ( AP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 SYDNEY : After 504 runs to show in 10 away Tests at an average of 29 , with almost a habitual tendency to give up on good starts , there are reasons to suggest that Shikhar Dhawan 's presence in the Indian dressing room , of late , has been a cause of 'unrest' . A note of caution hangs over his selection for the fourth Test against Australia in Sydney starting next week and even if the 29-year-old makes the cut again , he 'll walk out knowing that time 's running out . If knowing your off-stump is indeed the most vital ingredient in Test match batting , Dhawan 's effort , or the lack of it , has been a mess so far. Tom Moody , the former Australia all-rounder and Dhawan 's coach at Sunrisers Hyderabad , is convinced the batsman has work to do . " The most important factor for any Test batsman is to understand where their off-stump is. At times , Shikhar can have that uncertainty .It 's a different game in ODI s because you do n't have that field setting behind stumps , two or three slips , a gully etc. and those thick edges run down to third man , " says Moody . " He should always look to play positive cricket but that ability to leave the ball is very important too , " he says. " When the ball is in that area , that corridor of fourth or fifth off-stump , knowing when to leave it makes all the difference , " he said. " The frustrating thing is that he has got starts on a number of occasions on this tour.
