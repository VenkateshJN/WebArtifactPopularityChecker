New Zealand v Sri Lanka , 6th ODI , Dunedin January 25 , 2015 Unavailable DRS leaves SL fuming 49 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Comment shares 49 Dhammika Prasad had this voracious appeal against Martin Guptill turned down , and was n't allowed to review thanks to faulty video equipment at his end © Getty Images Technical malfunction prevented Sri Lanka from reviewing an lbw decision against Martin Guptill in the fourth over of the sixth ODI in Dunedin , causing significant displeasure among the fielding team . Dhammika Prasad jagged a length ball into Guptill , who was batting on four , and hit him below the knee-roll , in front of off and middle stump. The ball had evaded Guptill 's bat and appeared to be heading for the stumps , but umpire Derek Walker turned down the voracious appeal from Prasad and Sri Lanka . The bowler motioned vigorously to his teammates that a review should be sought , but both captain Lahiru Thirimanne and wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara appeared to be aware that DRS was unavailable from the end Prasad was bowling from , and did not request a review. Umpire Walker confirmed that DRS was not available , thanks apparently to a fault in the video equipment at that end . Sri Lanka were visibly irked by the incident , however , with Mahela Jayawardene audibly complaining that the episode was " rubbish " . Prasad was also seen in conversation with Walker , both during that over and immediately after it . Guptill was eventually out for 28 in the 14th over , after Walker had once more turned down an appeal , this time for a catch to the wicketkeeper. That decision was overturned on evidence from Hotspot and Snicko , however. The DRS cameras and ball projection software were not needed .
