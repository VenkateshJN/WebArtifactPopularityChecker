15 Mar 2007 * World Cup matches There was a surprise at the toss , with experienced all-rounder Shane Watson dropped to allow James Faulkner to return after a side strain , but the onslaught that followed was extremely predictable . The dashing Warner led the way and accelerated markedly after reaching three figures from 92 balls . Dropped on 114 , the left-hander seemed set to compound Watson 's misery by passing his Australian ODI record of 185 not out against Bangladesh in Dhaka in 2011 only to sky a delivery to mid-on from the bowling of Shapoor Zadran ( 2-89 ) . He had faced 133 balls , hitting 19 fours and five sixes. Warner 's assault on the hapless Afghan bowlers brought back memories of Matthew Hayden plundering a weak Zimbabwe attack for an Australian Test record 380 at the same venue in 2003 . Although Warner fell shy of the overall ODI individual record , he passed the previous mark for the highest innings by an Australian at the WACA , which previously belonged to Damien Martyn for his 144 against Zimbabwe in 2001 . Warner and Steve Smith , who made 95 , also set a new benchmark for an Australian partnership in ODI cricket with their 260-run second-wicket stand from 209 balls . The pair passed the previous record of 252 set by Watson and Ricky Ponting against England in South Africa in 2009 . All-rounder Glenn Maxwell then chimed in with a quickfire 88 off 39 balls , including seven sixes , before being well caught at mid-off from the bowling of Dawlat Zadran ( 2-101 ) in the 48th over . Australia face Sri Lanka at the SCG in their next match on Sunday , while things do n't get any easier for Afghanistan as they face unbeaten New Zealand on the same day at Napier in a bid to add to their lone win against Scotland .
