'Predictably unpredictable ' Pakistan have SA worried The author has posted comments on this article Dwaipayan Datta , TNN | Mar 6 , 2015 , 09.00AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 AUCKLAND : There 's something about Pakistan that always keeps their rivals on their toes. Call it the mystery element , the ability to play a blazing game out of nowhere or the " unpredictability factor " as the South African coach Russell Domingo suggested . The dimensions of the Eden Park , the presence of power-hitters and the pace bowing ammunition make South Africa the firm favourites for the Saturday blockbuster , but Domingo sounded a little defensive . " They are a predictably unpredictable side. You do n't always know what they will bring to the table on the given day and that 's what makes them a very dangerous side , " Domingo said . Pakistan had beaten South Africa in the Proteas ' own backyard last year and that 's what is making Domingo all the more cautious . " Pakistan is a big team , they have the match-winners and they have beaten us in the recent past. We have to ensure that we do n't get lulled by the strength of their game and do what we know best - play a solid game of cricket , " Domingo added . One of the Pakistani players keeping the South Africans worried is Mohammad Irfan. Even though he bowled only three overs in the game against UAE due to the recurrence of an old injury , the Pakistan team management is hoping that he will be fit for Saturday . " Irfan 's height makes him a very awkward customer to handle and he has been bowling well in the tournament. But one thing that probably helps us decode the mystery about Irfan is the presence of Morne Morkel in our team. He is also very tall and our batsmen play Morne in the nets , " Domingo said .
