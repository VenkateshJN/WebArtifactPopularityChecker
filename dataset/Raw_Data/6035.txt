Virender Sehwag 175 against Bangladesh in 2011 Bangladesh vs India , 1st Match , Group B Fri , Feb 13 2015 As co-hosts of the 2011 World Cup , India were definitely one of the favourites. They went about establishing their supremacy by overcoming top sides and it all started with a big win against Bangladesh in their only away match. Virender Sehwag was the one who kick-started India 's glorious journey with a terrific knock in their opening match. Many considered this as a revenge game as Bangladesh were one of the reasons behind India 's early exit in the 2007 World Cup and Sehwag mentioned exactly that after he finished his rampage. Not often does one get to see Sehwag bat for long periods in ODI cricket , but when he does , he leaves devastating impact. Bangladesh were witness to that when he blasted 175 off 140 deliveries , and with some help from Virat Kohli ( 100 * off 83 ) powered India to a massive 370/4. The hosts could not recover from the effect of Sehwag 's destruction as they fell 88 runs short. After the match , Sehwag revealed that his plan was to bat the entire duration of 50 overs and he nearly achieved what he set out to do .
