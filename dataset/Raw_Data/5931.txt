Graphs That 's all from here. Join us for the second Test match being played at Abu Dhabi on Thursday. Till then , take care . For now , Pakistan can rejoice this win. After all , they have outperformed the Aussies in every department of the game. Australia have to find a way to counter the spin. Otherwise , Pakistani spinners will continue their onslaught . With this , the first Test match comes to a close. After the pounding in the ODI series , Pakistan have done really well to go 1-0 in the Test series. However , their real test will be in Abu Dhabi , where they need to back this performance with another good one. With Clarke upbeat about his team 's chances in the second Test , do not count the Aussies out. They showed a glimpse of how well they can play with Smith and Johnson putting up a brave front against the Pakistani bowlers . Misbah : This was a much required win for us. We were really struggling in the last few series. We also lost the ODI series to them. It is a big win for us and for the youngsters who are around. Everybody was determined and we were playing well before as well but we did really well in every department in this Test match. These bowlers are young at the international level but they have a lot of first-class cricket experience. They knew how to bowl longer spells and they bowled really well. A few of them played the Australians in the practice match and it gave them confidence. We would go to Abu Dhabi and look to consolidate. We would like to win the series. We will try and put in a disciplined performance again . Younis Khan : First of all , I would like to thank all my support staff for everything. They have worked really hard with me. Be it Grant Flower or the others , everyone has helped me out. There is nothing better than my team winning because of me. It feels really good. I worked really hard with Grant Flower. There was a situation when I did n't want to play , but my family motivated me to come back. I got time to watch how the Australians play and we tried a few new things. I got hit on the shoulder and the ribs. But , I was ready for the stiff task of facing Johnson. We are a very young team and Australia is a top ranked team. If you see the overall team performance , everyone has played really well . Younis Khan spoke about his performance in Urdu. I am paraphrasing what he said . Younis Khan is the Man of the Match for his centuries in both innings Michael Clarke : There 's no doubt that they deserve credit. They outplayed us in all the three departments. We did n't play as we would have liked but we will try to turn things around in time for the second Test. We would probably like to keep our bats in front ( referring to so many lbw decisions ) . Steven Smith and Mitchell Johnson played really well and deserve the credit. Younis certainly showed the example. He showed us how to play spin and how to play reverse swing. We got outplayed in all three facets of the game and we will look to turn it around in the second Test. We can definitely turn things around in the next Test. The boys will work hard over the next few days and we will definitely perform well in the next match. I am sure you will see a different team in the next game . Time for the presentation ceremony.. . Chasing a daunting total of 438 , Australia never got going. The openers were fine till they reached 44. Warner got stumped and that opened the floodgates. Australia were 59/4 going into Day 5 and a Pakistani win looked inevitable. However , Smith and Johnson played well but could only delay the Pakistani-win. At the end , Pakistan won the game by 221 runs and they go 1-0 up in this 2-match Test series . Batting second , Pakistan was again on the money. With Hafeez out due to an injury , Azhar Ali had to open with Ahmed Shehzad , who left his poor dismissal in the first innings behind and went on to score a brilliant hundred. Younis provided him great support , notching up his 26th hundred in the process . Younis Khan was brilliant with the bat , scoring centuries in both the innings and while doing so , he became the 12th man in the history of cricket to have scored a century against all Test playing nations. The real key to this win was the first innings batting performance. After the openers departed early , the middle order did extremely well to post 454 on the board. Three fifties and two centuries did the trick for them there. When Australia came out to bat , they looked very good. The first wicket stand of more than a 100 runs was probably the only real partnership they had in the first innings. Wickets fell away quickly after that and Pakistan took a lead of 151 runs . Pakistan deserved this win. They have batted extremely well and their bowlers also deserve credit for keeping Australian batsmen at bay. Apart from David Warner 's century in the first innings , Australia have nothing really to show for. They have been comprehensively beaten here. Being 7/2 at one stage , Pakistan has surely scripted one of their best wins in a long time . Zulfiqar Babar is holding the match ball. He finishes with 5/74 in the second innings. Babar has taken 7 wickets in the match . Misbah becomes the oldest captain to win a Test against Australia. Pakistani players are hugging one another. The support staff and their coach Waqar Younis are very happy. There are handshakes and hugs all around . 91.1 Babar to Siddle , out Caught by Azhar Ali ! ! Finally , Pakistan have won it. Pakistani players are jubilant as this is only the second time since 1995 that Pakistan have beaten Australia in a Test. It was floated on off , Siddle went for the defensive push after coming down the track and the ball takes the inside edge onto the pad , loops for Azhar Ali , who moves forward to take the catch at silly point. Siddle thought he had n't hit it and went for the review. However , replays showed that there was a clear inside edge. Siddle c Azhar Ali b Babar 15 ( 48 ) [ 4s-1 ] Babar to Siddle , THATS OUT ! ! Caught ! ! There is some confusion on whether Siddle is out or not. Umpire Erasmus gives it 'Out ' but Siddle has reviewed it. It looks like Siddle did get an inside edge and the onfield decision has been upheld . 90.6 Yasir Shah to O'Keefe , no run , goes on the front foot and defends it 90.5 Yasir Shah to O'Keefe , no run , floated outside off and O'Keefe pads it , there was half an appeal from the close-in fielders but it can never be given out 90.4 Yasir Shah to O'Keefe , no run , a little flatter outside off and spins further away from the batsman , O'Keefe leaves 90.3 Yasir Shah to O'Keefe , no run , pushed through on off and middle , O'Keefe leans forward and blocks 90.2 Yasir Shah to O'Keefe , no run , floated on off , O'Keefe presses forward and blocks it to silly point 90.1 Yasir Shah to O'Keefe , no run , lunges forward in defence 89.6 Babar to Siddle , no run , went back in the crease and blocks 89.6 Babar to Siddle , no ball , Babar oversteps this time , Siddle comes forward and dead-bats it 89.5 Babar to Siddle , no run , goes on the back foot and blocks it to the right of the bowler 89.4 Babar to Siddle , 2 runs , push drives a flighted delivery outside off towards deep extra cover 89.3 Babar to Siddle , no run , drives this tossed up delivery to short cover 89.2 Babar to Siddle , no run , arm ball from Babar , Siddle misses the defensive push and is hit on the pads , a huge appeal from the Pakistani players but the onfield umpire adjudged it 'Not Out' Pakistan have decided to review another lbw decision. The onfield umpire Erasmus gave it 'Not Out'. There is no problem with Babar 's front foot. Replays show that there was no inside edge on that. Pakistani players look very confident that they have got their man. Hawk-Eye shows that the ball will clip the leg stump and so , the onfield decision will be upheld . 89.1 Babar to Siddle , no run , drives this fuller delivery towards point Zulfiqar Babar [ 30.0-7-71-4 ] is back into the attack Steve O'Keefe , right handed bat , comes to the crease 88.6 Yasir Shah to Johnson , out Stumped ! ! It was pushed through outside off , Johnson looked to push at it , the ball goes past the outside edge as Johnson puts a big stride in , he is a little late to drag his foot back and Sarfraz takes the bails off in a flash. A brave innings from Johnson comes to an end. Pakistan are extremely happy with the decision. Johnson st Sarfraz Ahmed b Yasir Shah 61 ( 127 ) [ 4s-6 6s-1 ] Yasir Shah to Johnson , THATS OUT ! ! Stumped ! ! There is a huge stumping appeal from Sarfraz , who is confident that he has got his man here. This looks very close. Johnson probably did n't drag his foot back in time. The foot appears to be on the line. Replays show that there is probably nothing behind the line. Will the third umpire rule this in favour of Pakistan ? It 's a very tough one for the third umpire. And he has adjudged Johnson out. Pakistani players are ecstatic. They are just one wicket away from winning this one . 88.5 Yasir Shah to Johnson , no run , steps out of the crease and defends it 88.4 Yasir Shah to Johnson , no run , goes back in the crease and blocks 88.3 Yasir Shah to Johnson , no run , flatter and turns back in towards Johnson , who does n't offer a shot , the Pakistani players appealed as the ball hit him on the pads , but it was a little too high Pakistan have gone for a review for a lbw decision. The onfield decision was 'Not Out'.

Imran Khan reversed out Rogers and then Babar took over , getting Marsh and Haddin quickly. Smith has looked very assured , but he is only delaying the inevitable ? Should be a quick wrap after lunch for Pakistan , or do Australia have other plans ? Do join us soon to find out.

Caught at leg slip and Kettleborough got it right 50.2 Yasir Shah to Johnson , no run , goes back and whips it to square leg 50.1 Yasir Shah to Johnson , no run , iffy shot. Pre-meditated paddle sweep attempted and Johnson misses , is hit on the arm 49.6 Babar to S Smith , 2 runs , Smith is n't happy with just two.

Sarfraz had the bails off , but Smith was always in 47.4 Babar to S Smith , no run , use of the feet , but too close to the pitch was Smith , so he can only find mid-off 47.3 Babar to Johnson , 1 run , turned past short leg and that allows Johnson to get off the mark 47.2 Babar to Johnson , no run , that is a close shave ! Johnson left that alone and it spun out of the rough , almost clipped off. Oohs and aahs from the Pakistanis Mitchell Johnson , left handed bat , comes to the crease 47.1 Babar to Haddin , out Bowled ! ! How did Haddin miss that ? It was a floaty looped up delivery on middle and leg , there was a slight gap between Haddin 's bat and pad , the ball found its way and brushed the back leg before hitting leg.

Bowled ! ! 46.6 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , ripping leggie to end , as Smith watches it through into the keeper 's gloves 46.5 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , looked like the googly , yes it is , but too short and punched to cover 46.4 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , calmly defended off the front foot 46.3 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , comes on the front foot and defends 46.2 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , sharp turn away for Yasir Shah , but the line is outside off , so left alone 46.1 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , uses his feet and tries to drive , but the bat turns and a thick outside half is found , dribbles wide of cover Yasir Shah [ 11.0-2-18-2 ] is back into the attack 45.6 Babar to Haddin , no run , very full on the stumps , Haddin is content to defend once again 45.5 Babar to Haddin , no run , sliding onto middle and leg , Haddin defends it back to Babar 45.4 Babar to Haddin , no run , goes back to block 45.3 Babar to Haddin , no run , defended in front of Azhar at silly point 45.2 Babar to Haddin , no run , floated on off , Haddin gets forward and defends 45.1 Babar to Haddin , no run , Haddin prefers to defend off the back foot to that one 44.6 Imran Khan to S Smith , 2 runs , low full toss , eased wide of Hafeez at mid-off , who allows the couple 44.5 Imran Khan to S Smith , no run , wicket-to-wicket stuff , Smith defends 44.4 Imran Khan to S Smith , no run , pitched up outside off , dead-batted after coming forward 44.3 Imran Khan to S Smith , no run , short of length on the stumps , defended off the back foot 44.2 Imran Khan to S Smith , 2 runs , almost yorker length outside off , Smith opens the face of the bat and squeezes it wide of gully for a couple of runs 44.1 Imran Khan to S Smith , no run , bouncer , easily dealt with as Smith lets it go Azhar is standing very close at silly point and is anticipating really well. He is almost expecting a catch every ball , moving forward with the batsman 's stroke. A one-handed take to remove Marsh as he caught it with the left-hand and then threw it away. Super stuff from Azhar . 43.6 Babar to Haddin , no run , blocked back to the bowler 43.5 Babar to Haddin , no run , once again played with hard hands and almost another one for Azhar at silly point , in the air for a while but safely back to the bowler 43.4 Babar to Haddin , no run , pushes forward and defends it back to Babar Brad Haddin , right handed bat , comes to the crease 43.3 Babar to M Marsh , out Caught by Azhar Ali ! ! Fine catch at silly point. Dad Geoff is disappointed. Double failure for the debutant. He played forward with hard hands and it went straight off the face of the bat , sharp reflex catch by Azhar who clutched it onto his chest. Once again a bowling change has worked for Pakistan. M Marsh c Azhar Ali b Babar 3 ( 8 ) Babar to M Marsh , THATS OUT ! ! Caught ! ! Marsh is gone 43.2 Babar to M Marsh , no run , defended to short leg Four men around the bat 43.1 Babar to M Marsh , no run , punched off the back foot to mid-on Zulfiqar Babar [ 12.0-3-29-2 ] is back into the attack 42.6 Imran Khan to S Smith , no run , onto the front foot and defended to mid-off. Solidly done 42.5 Imran Khan to S Smith , no run , a little shuffle across and then defended to mid-on 42.4 Imran Khan to M Marsh , 3 runs , high full toss as Imran Khan looks for the yorker , Marsh forces it wide of mid-wicket , the ball plugs in the outfield , so it 's a three 42.3 Imran Khan to S Smith , 1 run , goes for the yorker , but the line is on middle and leg , so tapped to the short mid-wicket region 42.2 Imran Khan to S Smith , no run , short of length outside off , left alone 42.1 Imran Khan to S Smith , no run , full on off , blocked confidently 41.6 Hafeez to M Marsh , no run , gets back to block 41.5 Hafeez to S Smith , 3 runs , there is no-one at cover , so Smith 's drive finds the gap and it 's good enough for three runs 41.4 Hafeez to S Smith , no run , forward and blocked to the short mid-wicket fielder 41.3 Hafeez to S Smith , 2 runs , shortish outside off and punched into the gap at cover for a couple of runs 41.2 Hafeez to S Smith , no run , right forward and defending 41.1 Hafeez to S Smith , no run , defended off the back foot to short leg Replays for that Rogers ' dismissal show that after he completed the stroke , the bat face closed , meaning he was looking to play it to leg 40.6 Imran Khan to M Marsh , no run , fine effort from Hafeez at mid-off , saved a certain boundary , it was driven to his right and at speed , but he pulled out a dive to keep it to a dot 40.5 Imran Khan to M Marsh , no run , short of length and that gives Marsh an easier task , defended off the back foot 40.4 Imran Khan to M Marsh , no run , full and reversing in , driven back to the bowler Mitchell Marsh , right handed bat , comes to the crease 40.3 Imran Khan to Chris Rogers , out Bowled ! ! That 's a ripper. Superb delivery from Imran Khan to get Chris Rogers. He came round the wicket for this delivery and definite reverse for the bowler , who fired it in , Rogers looked to push it through mid-off , but the ball sneaked through the gap to land on the stumps. Imran Khan celebrates and that is a big wicket , for Rogers could 've grinded out the Pakistani attack. Game over ?

Polite query from Hafeez , nothing doing from Erasmus 39.5 Hafeez to S Smith , no run , tossed up outside off and turning in , Smith defends off the back foot 39.4 Hafeez to Chris Rogers , 1 run , there is a gap at short mid-wicket , so Chris Rogers ' work gets him a single 39.3 Hafeez to Chris Rogers , no run , full toss , Rogers comes down the track and whips it straight to the fielder at mid-on 39.2 Hafeez to Chris Rogers , no run , skids on , but Rogers prefers to defend off the back foot and does so 39.1 Hafeez to Chris Rogers , no run , shortish outside off , punched to point Mohammad Hafeez [ 8.0-3-15-0 ] is back into the attack That will be drinks. So that 's one hour chalked off out of the 6 that Australia have to bat out to save the Test. Nothing much happened in that hour for the Pakistanis. Both batsmen were patient and saw off the odd good ball. Only Rahat got some reverse and posed a few problems for Rogers. Let 's see if the second hour is any different . 38.6 Imran Khan to S Smith , no run , very full on off and middle , blocked to the short mid-wicket fielder 38.5 Imran Khan to S Smith , no run , tight defensive stroke by Smith as he blocks it dead 38.4 Imran Khan to S Smith , no run , this one angles in towards off and middle , Smith shows the full face of the bat and defends to mid-on 38.3 Imran Khan to S Smith , no run , back of a length outside off , Smith lets it go 38.2 Imran Khan to S Smith , no run , short of length and seaming away , left alone Two slips and a gully in 38.1 Imran Khan to S Smith , no run , pitched up outside off , softly driven to short cover Imran Khan [ 1.0-0-6-0 ] is back into the attack 37.6 Rahat Ali to S Smith , 1 run , too full on the pads once more , tapped to the deep backward square leg fielder 37.5 Rahat Ali to Chris Rogers , 3 runs , overpitched on middle and leg , easy pickings for Chris Rogers , who flicks past short mid-wicket. Misbah has to chase and he ca n't prevent the third 37.4 Rahat Ali to Chris Rogers , 2 runs , well played. Gets on top of the bounce and punches it into the gap at cover. For a couple of runs 37.3 Rahat Ali to Chris Rogers , no run , opens the face of the bat and guides to the point fielder 37.2 Rahat Ali to Chris Rogers , 2 runs , looked for the yorker , but turned out to be a full toss , nudged into the deep backward square leg area for a couple of runs 37.1 Rahat Ali to Chris Rogers , no run , worked to the left of Misbah at short mid-wicket 36.6 Hafeez to Chris Rogers , 1 run , slightly short outside off , chopped wide of Yasir at point , only a single as the fielder charges after it 36.5 Hafeez to Chris Rogers , no run , smothered off the front foot 36.4 Hafeez to Chris Rogers , no run , half-forward and then defends it back to Hafeez 36.3 Hafeez to Chris Rogers , no run , uses his feet and pushes it past Hafeez 36.2 Hafeez to Chris Rogers , no run , played with soft hands and that ensured that it did n't go to the 2nd slip fielder 36.1 Hafeez to Chris Rogers , no run , floated outside off , turning away , left alone 35.6 Rahat Ali to Chris Rogers , 1 run , an impressive over from Rahat Ali comes to an end after Chris Rogers drives wide of mid-off 35.5 Rahat Ali to Chris Rogers , no run , full outside off , a front foot drive to mid-off Now a leg slip is brought in 35.4 Rahat Ali to Chris Rogers , no run , this is very good bowling. Chris Rogers is unsure about which ones are coming in and which ones are n't. He fiddles with one outside off and is lucky not to have edged it. Very iffy batting Reverse happening for Rahat Ali now. He is getting late tail 35.3 Rahat Ali to Chris Rogers , no run , that was missing leg. There is an appeal for lbw after Chris Rogers is pinged on the pad , but Erasmus got it right 35.2 Rahat Ali to Chris Rogers , no run , is on the front foot this time and a nice punchy drive past the right-hand of Rahat Ali 35.1 Rahat Ali to Chris Rogers , no run , beaten and even Chris Rogers is impressed by that delivery. Back of a length outside off and straightening , Rogers is playing for the indipper and the straightening beats him as he looked to defend 34.6 Hafeez to S Smith , no run , for this one he prefers to go back , once again kept out 34.5 Hafeez to S Smith , no run , very full and negotiated by Smith on the front foot 34.4 Hafeez to S Smith , no run , uses his feet and then blocks it back to Hafeez 34.3 Hafeez to S Smith , no run , conventional offie , easily defended off the back foot 34.2 Hafeez to S Smith , no run , goes straight on outside off , Smith defends to silly point 34.1 Hafeez to S Smith , no run , turned to short leg 33.6 Rahat Ali to Chris Rogers , no run , that reversed definitely and Chris Rogers ' leave was a dangerous one. It did n't come back in enough to hit off , but was mighty close to doing so 33.5 Rahat Ali to S Smith , 1 run , too straight and Smith gets inside the line to tuck it to deep backward square leg 33.4 Rahat Ali to S Smith , no run , back of a length outside off , slanted across Smith , who shoulders arms 33.3 Rahat Ali to Chris Rogers , 1 run , Rahat Ali is looking for the yorker , hint of reverse happening , but this time he overpitches on leg stump , glanced down to fine leg 33.2 Rahat Ali to S Smith , 1 run , very full on middle and leg , worked away into the mid-wicket region 33.1 Rahat Ali to S Smith , no run , Smith shuffles across to cover off stump his defensive shot produces an inside edge onto the pads.

Should be a good day . Pitch report : 'This is still a very good pitch , it needs application and concentration to get through this ' reckons Dean Jones. He doubts Australia surviving the day . Chris Rogers : 'Credit to the Pakistani players that they have played an amazing game. We will try to hang in there. It 's a challenge to bat on this wicket with some balls turning and some not. It is tough work to bat out there. Without a doubt , we have to believe that anything can happen ( on salvaging a draw ) . We will have to keep trying hard.' Hello and welcome to the final day of the first Test between Australia and Pakistan. Right now , a win for Pakistan looks the most likely result we will get out of this game. But , can Australia show their mettle and survive the day ? Or will Pakistan run through their batting line-up ? We will find out soon. Stay tuned.. . Pakistan , on the other hand , will be looking to wrap things up as quickly as possible. Both Zulfiqar Babar and debutant Yasir Shah have been exceptional in this game. They have been far better than the Australian spinners - Lyon and O'Keefe. Babar and Shah have been well supported by Hafeez with his off-spin. The pacers - Rahat Ali and Imran Khan have only bowled one over each in the second innings. Even today , spinners will probably do the bulk of the bowling . Currently , Australia are in distress. They are 379 runs behind and are staring at another Test defeat. Remember , the last time these two sides played in a Test , Pakistan emerged as the winner at Leeds in 2010. The remaining Australian batsmen will have to face the wrath of the Pakistani spinners , who were phenomenal in the last few overs yesterday. Michael Clarke , the best player of spin in the Australian ranks is also back in the pavillion. With Rogers and Smith on the crease , and with Marsh , Haddin and the bowlers to come , it will be a humongous task for Australia to keep the Pakistani spinners out . Tomorrow promises to be another important day for both the sides. Pakistan will look to dismantle the Australian batting line-up as quickly as possible. On the other hand , the situation looks very bleak for Australia , who would have to bat 90 overs on a turning wicket on Day 5. Will Pakistan cruise to a much deserved win ? Or will Australia manage to save some grace ? Join us tomorrow to find out. Till then , take care and enjoy . Pakistan must be extremely happy with what they have achieved going into the final day. They are 6 wickets away from a famous win. Earlier , Shehzad and Younis batted brilliantly to take Pakistan 's lead past 400. Both of them completed their centuries with Younis Khan , getting to his second hundred in the same match. This feat of scoring two hundreds in the same match against Australia was last done 40 years back , by Glenn Turner of New Zealand in 1974. Pakistani spinners have impressed so far. Both Zulfiqar Babar and Yasir Shah have accounted for two wickets each in the second Australian innings so far . So , Day 4 comes to an end after a thrilling post-tea session. Warner and Rogers looked all set to emulate their first innings partnership until a moment of madness from Warner , who got stumped in trying to hit one over the infield. After his departure , the floodgates opened and Australia lost 4 wickets in a space of 5 runs ( 44/0 to 49/4 ) . After Warner , Doolan , Clarke and night watchman Lyon could n't do much and departed in quick succession. Clarke 's wicket was a difficult one as replays showed that he might have got an inside edge. However , Clarke himself did n't go for the review and as it stands Australia are 59/4 . 22.6 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , straighter one outside off that keeps a little low , Smith lets it go Last ball of the day coming up.. . 22.5 Yasir Shah to Chris Rogers , 1 run , too full from Shah this time around , Rogers goes forward and opens the face of the bat , the ball goes to backward point and Rogers takes a single 22.4 Yasir Shah to Chris Rogers , no run , leans forward and looks to block , the ball takes the inside edge onto the pad and dribbles away into the off-side 22.3 Yasir Shah to Chris Rogers , no run , shortish delivery that spins back in a great deal , Rogers looks to pull of the back foot , he fails to connect and the ball clips the thigh pad on its way to the leg slip 22.2 Yasir Shah to Chris Rogers , no run , goes on the back foot and turns it towards square leg 22.1 Yasir Shah to Chris Rogers , no run , big spin on this one , the leg-spinner from Shah spins from around off and the keeper had to take it down the leg side 21.6 Hafeez to S Smith , no run , lunges forward in defence 21.5 Hafeez to S Smith , no run , defended from the crease 21.4 Hafeez to S Smith , no run , that was extremely close ! Smith is lucky there. It was flighted around off , Smith gave him the charge and could only push it towards silly point , who was quick to react and threw the ball back at the stumps , had he hit , it would have been curtains for Smith , who tried to dive back into the crease. That was very close 21.3 Hafeez to Chris Rogers , 1 run , almost squared him up there , Rogers was looking to defend and the ball spins away a little , taking a thick outside edge that dribbles away towards backward point 21.2 Hafeez to Chris Rogers , no run , goes on the back foot and turns this towards FSL , who moves to his left to make the stop 21.1 Hafeez to Chris Rogers , no run , flighted delivery on off and middle , Rogers lunges forward in defence , the ball rolls away to the left of the bowler after taking the inside edge Mohammad Hafeez [ 4.0-2-11-0 ] is back into the attack 20.6 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , Smith walks out of the crease and defends this delivery on off and middle with the full face of the bat 20.5 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , goes forward and blocks 20.4 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , keeps a little low and Smith can only defend it after going back in the crease 20.3 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , beautiful delivery from Shah , it was bowled on middle and leg and spun away from the batsman very sharply , Smith gets beaten as he looks to defend 20.2 Yasir Shah to Chris Rogers , 1 run , pitched on middle and leg , Rogers works it towards short mid-wicket and a misfield allows the batsman to take a single 20.1 Yasir Shah to Chris Rogers , no run , spins back in towards the batsman , Rogers turns it to square leg 19.6 Babar to Chris Rogers , 3 runs , flighted delivery around off and carries on with the angle , Rogers goes on the back foot , opens the face of the bat and pushes it square of the wicket 19.5 Babar to Chris Rogers , no run , floated outside off and Rogers lets it go through to the keeper 19.4 Babar to Chris Rogers , no run , flatter and on middle and leg , Rogers can only turn it towards the leg slip 19.3 Babar to S Smith , 1 run , comes down the track and works this flighted delivery towards short mid-wicket 19.2 Babar to S Smith , no run , pushed through on middle and leg , the ball keeps a touch low , Smith manages to get his bat down in time , the ball rolls away into the leg-side 19.1 Babar to S Smith , no run , comes down the track and almost yorks himself , Smith can only squeeze it towards short mid-wicket 18.6 Yasir Shah to S Smith , 1 run , floated on middle and leg , Smith comes down the track and eases it down towards long-on 18.5 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , tossed up on off , Smith leans forward and defends 18.4 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , loopy delivery just outside off , Smith goes forward and looks to drive , he misses and the ball goes through towards the keeper , the ball richocets onto the stumps after hitting Sarfraz 's pad , the umpires have gone to third umpire to check whether Smith was back in the crease after the ball deflected onto the stumps after hitting the pad , the big screen shows 'Not Out ' and Smith stays 18.3 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , slower delivery outside off , Smith blocks 18.2 Yasir Shah to Chris Rogers , leg byes , 1 run , flatter delivery straying on the pads , Rogers stays back and looks to glance , he misses and the ball goes away fine after clipping the pad 18.1 Yasir Shah to S Smith , 1 run , flighted delivery around off , Smith steps out of the crease and pushes at the ball , the ball rolls away towards square leg after taking the inside edge , the batsmen run a single 17.6 Babar to Chris Rogers , no run , goes on the back foot and blocks it with the full face of the bat 17.5 Babar to Chris Rogers , no run , floated just outside off and spinning back in , Rogers blocks , the ball rolls away behind off the face of the bat , Rogers puts his pad in the way just to keep the ball away from going towards the stumps 17.4 Babar to Chris Rogers , no run , flighted delivery around off and spinning in towards the batsman , Rogers pads it away 17.3 Babar to Chris Rogers , no run , flatter delivery around off , Rogers rocks back and defends 17.2 Babar to Chris Rogers , no run , stays on the back foot and blocks it towards short cover 17.1 Babar to Chris Rogers , no run , pushes this one towards point from the crease 16.6 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , comes down the track to a flatter delivery , can only pad-bat it into the off-side Steven Smith , right handed bat , comes to the crease 16.5 Yasir Shah to Lyon , out Lbw ! !

Replays show that the ball went past the outside edge and Rogers should stay. The final decision is 'Not Out ' and the onfield decision is overturned . Drinks are on the field now.

We 'll bring you all that and much more. Do n't go anywhere. Do stay tuned. Back soon . That 's lunch on day 4. Even though it has been slow progress , Pakistan have inched ahead even more. Only 78 runs has been scored in the 31 overs that have been bowled.

Let 's see 37.5 Johnson to Ahmed Shehzad , no run , that is a very good short delivery and it has pinged Ahmed Shehzad. He flings his glove away and calls for the physio. Dug in short once more and well-directed at the chest area of the batsman , Shehzad was looking to fend that away , the ball thudded into the ribs/chest area. Hit flush and that would 've stung. A slight break in play as Shehzad sips some water and gets attention 37.4 Johnson to Ahmed Shehzad , no run , dug in short , but down leg , so Ahmed Shehzad can duck under that and leave Now round the wicket is Johnson 37.3 Johnson to Ahmed Shehzad , no run , well wide of off and Ahmed Shehzad wo n't play at that 37.2 Johnson to Ahmed Shehzad , no run , short of length on off , Ahmed Shehzad confidently gets forward to defend Two slips and a gully in place 37.1 Johnson to Ahmed Shehzad , no run , fuller length outside off , left alone Mitchell Johnson [ 5.0-1-17-0 ] is back into the attack 36.6 O'Keefe to Younis Khan , no run , Younis Khan looked to punch that through cover , but he did n't time it at all , the ball rolls to Warner at cover 36.5 O'Keefe to Ahmed Shehzad , 1 run , gets to fifty with a single to long-off.

He was wicketless in the first innings. Just one slip and a short cover in place Mitchell Marsh , right-arm medium , comes into the attack Drinks are on the field now. Pakistan have made steady progress in that hour of play. The lead is now 234 and with each passing run , the task gets stiffer for Australia.

Siddle will start off proceedings. Clarke is making a few changes in the field. Here we go then.. . Pitch report : A lot of rough has developed which should make it interesting for the spinners. A few pebbles are found on the pitch as well. 'Overall it is still a good battable pitch ' says Ramiz Raja. What is battable ? Only Ramiz would know. He signs off by saying that Australia will have to bat out of their skins to save this match . Haddin : 'It was n't a great day for us yesterday. Warner was outstanding , but guys who got in did n't go on to make big scores. We have a big fight on our hands on the last two days. We were n't disciplined enough to get a big score. The first hour and a half will be very important. We need early wickets. That will dictate the rest of the passsage of play. They have players who understand Test cricket , they play very well in these conditions.' Speaking to Rameez Raja , Waqar Younis was happy with the way his team has performed so far. He says the team is bonding well under him and his support staff. He is n't setting any targets as of now , preferring to take session by session. However , he feels a target around 400-450 might make it a challenging target for Australia . Currently , Azhar Ali and Ahmed Shehzad are on the crease as Mohammad Hafeez did n't come out to bat after doing some harm to his ankle yesterday. Apart from putting up a big total on the board , Pakistan will have to give themselves enough time to bowl Australia out for the second time. It is going to be an enthralling last two days. Stay tuned for the action.. . This match is poised for an exciting finish. Pakistan hold the upper hand for now but Australia can also save this game as there are only two days left. Pakistan 's first task will be to put this game out of Australia 's reach. Also , they must have an idea as to what total should be enough for Australia in the fourth innings. Hello and Welcome to Day 4 of the First Test at Dubai . It 's going to be a fascinating day tomorrow as Pakistan will look to push on from here. For Australia , they will have to rethink a plan that allows them to save the game at least. It will be a crucial day for both teams tomorrow and maybe a day , where the result of the match is decided. Do join us tomorrow for another great day of Test cricket. Till then , take care. See you . Stumps , Day 3 : Another entertaining day comes to an end. Pakistan will be very happy with how things are at the present moment. They have extended their lead to 189 as they made 38/0 in the 13 overs they batted. Australia are on the back foot now. They really do n't know how to go about things at the present moment. Clarke 's decision to hand out the ball to Lyon after Siddle bowled a maiden shows the indecision in the camp. Pakistan are truly on top here but do n't count Australia out. The Australians have a tendency to bounce back when everyone rules them out. On the other hand , do n't be too sure about Pakistan 's fortunes as well. They tend to collapse when everything is going right for them . The light meters are out and the umpires are taking a reading. They have decided that it 's time to go back in the hut as it is pretty dark out on the ground. Players walk off the field.

Hafeez looks in a lot of discomfort. Has he twisted his ankle ? The physio is out and tending to him. Hafeez is going off for now as he definitely needs some treatment done on that ankle. The good thing is that he is walking out of the field all by himself. However , he looks in some pain . 95.4 Hafeez to O'Keefe , no run , flighted on off , O'Keefe goes forward and drives it to the right of the bowler , Hafeez goes to collect the ball and trips over very awkwardly after stepping on Johnson 's shoes at the non-striker 's end 95.3 Hafeez to O'Keefe , no run , tossed up on off , O'Keefe drives to the right of the bowler 95.2 Hafeez to O'Keefe , no run , flighted delivery just outside off , O'Keefe presses forward and blocks it into the off-side 95.1 Hafeez to O'Keefe , no run , loopy delivery on off , O'Keefe lunges forward in defence 94.6 Babar to Johnson , no run , shortish in length and just around off , Johnson pushes at it , the ball rolls away towards the keeper off the face of the bat 94.5 Babar to O'Keefe , 1 run , flatter and on middle , O'Keefe goes back in the crease and punches it towards mid-wicket for a single 94.4 Babar to O'Keefe , no run , tossed up on off , O'Keefe goes on the front foot and blocks to FSL 94.3 Babar to Johnson , 1 run , flighted delivery that turns back in towards the batsman , Johnson moves across and flicks it to backward square leg 94.2 Babar to Johnson , no run , tossed up around off , defended from the crease 94.1 Babar to Johnson , no run , flatter around off , Johnson looks to defend and gets beaten 93.6 Hafeez to Johnson , 1 run , full and on middle and leg , Johnson works it towards mid-wicket 93.5 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , flighted delivery outside off , Johnson puts his front foot across and shoulders arms 93.4 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , tossed up on off and middle , defended off the front foot 93.3 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , flighted delivery on the off stump , Johnson goes on the front foot and pushes to short cover 93.2 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , flighted outside off , Johnson lets it go 93.1 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , tossed up around off , Johnson leans forward and drives it to short cover Welcome back to the post-tea session. Pakistan will look to take the final two wickets quickly. On the other hand , Johnson and O'Keefe will look to bat as many overs as possible . The shadows are lengthening and it wo n't be easy to bat in artifical light in the final session. Australia 's task is cut out. Do join us soon for the final session of play. See you soon . Waqar Younis is on his feet and clapping that effort from his team who have won that session too. 4 wickets in that session once again and it all started off when Warner was out in the first over after lunch. The new ball was taken and it struck immediately as Imran Khan dismissed Brad Haddin. Then Marsh and Siddle fell lbw in quick succession to deepen the misery for the visitors. Pakistan would be looking to wrap this up and then bat well to put Australia under pressure in the fourth innings . 92.6 Babar to O'Keefe , no run , bat in front of the pad and defended to short mid-wicket. That will be tea on day 3 92.5 Babar to O'Keefe , no run , hint of turn away , O'Keefe watches it and then adjusts to dab it late down to point 92.4 Babar to O'Keefe , no run , drifting down leg , O'Keefe ca n't put it away 92.3 Babar to O'Keefe , no run , gets down the pitch and ekes out a little inside edge onto the pads , but just wide of short leg 92.2 Babar to Johnson , 1 run , uses his feet , but is n't to the pitch of the ball , yet goes through with the hoick , off the toe end and it rolls to deep mid-wicket 92.1 Babar to Johnson , no run , leans forward to block Last over before tea 91.6 Hafeez to O'Keefe , no run , defends to the right of Hafeez , still no run there 91.5 Hafeez to O'Keefe , no run , turns this to short mid-wicket 91.4 Hafeez to O'Keefe , no run , gets forward to defend to short cover 91.3 Hafeez to O'Keefe , no run , is on the back foot and defending 91.2 Hafeez to Johnson , 1 run , short and wide of off , Johnson reaches out and smashes the cut to sweeper cover 91.1 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , punched back to Hafeez 90.6 Babar to O'Keefe , no run , pitches in line and then goes away from the bat to strike O'Keefe high on the thigh. Would 've gone over , that 's why there was no real appeal from the Pakistanis 90.5 Babar to O'Keefe , no run , lunges forward to block 90.4 Babar to Johnson , 1 run , whipped in the air to deep mid-wicket , they thought about the second , but two fielders converged on the ball which forced the batsmen to retreat 90.3 Babar to O'Keefe , 3 runs , uses his feet and flicks it into the gap at mid-wicket , it was timed well enough for three runs 90.2 Babar to Johnson , 1 run , opens the face of the bat and plays it in the gap at point , takes the single too 90.1 Babar to Johnson , no run , punched back to Babar 89.6 Hafeez to O'Keefe , no run , well floated outside off , driven softly to mid-off 89.5 Hafeez to Johnson , 1 run , short-arm pulled to long-on 89.4 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , comes half-forward and pushes it to the off-side 89.3 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , flatter and on the stumps , defended off the back foot 89.2 Hafeez to O'Keefe , 1 run , comes down the track and pushes it to mid-on , gets off the mark with that single 89.1 Hafeez to Johnson , 1 run , short and outside off , flashed away to deep extra cover 88.6 Babar to O'Keefe , no run , sliding on from round the wicket , O'Keefe is caught on the forward push without bat on ball , but luckily for him , he got outside the line of off which saved him Another review for an lbw call. Not out is the call. Did O'Keefe get outside the line of off ? That could save him. Very similar to Marsh 's. Pitched in line and no inside edge onto the pads. Impact outside off and that saves O'Keefe. Not out is the call. So Pakistan have exhausted their quota of reviews too 88.5 Babar to O'Keefe , no run , gets forward and pushes it back to Babar 88.4 Babar to Johnson , 1 run , low full toss and it has been bunted wide of long-on. Two was the call , but the fielder was quick to get across 88.3 Babar to Johnson , no run , steps out , but the length is much shorter , Johnson defends 88.2 Babar to Johnson , no run , the straighter one beats Johnson on the forward defensive 88.1 Babar to Johnson , FOUR , now Johnson will take it on. Down on one knee and slog-swept wide of deep mid-wicket for a one-bounce four Steve O'Keefe , right handed bat , comes to the crease 87.6 Hafeez to Siddle , out Lbw ! ! That was a poor stroke. It was fired in flatter on off , Siddle missed a sweep and was struck right in front. He did n't get outside the line of off too. So a pretty straightforward decision for Kettleborough. No more reviews left for Australia. Siddle lbw b Hafeez 0 ( 4 ) Hafeez to Siddle , THATS OUT ! ! Lbw ! ! This has been given out lbw ! But Johnson and Siddle take the review. Looked pretty adjacent. Did he get outside the line of off ? Does n't look like it. OUT is the call. Pak celebrate again 87.5 Hafeez to Siddle , no run , once again Misbah and Hafeez ponder about a review and decide against it. It turned in sharply and missed the inside edge , struck Siddle on the back leg , was it spinning too much ? Need a replay to confirm all the doubts 87.4 Hafeez to Johnson , 1 run , punches it to long-on 87.3 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , pushes it to short cover 87.2 Hafeez to Johnson , FOUR , Hafeez is a disappointed man. Rahat Ali the culprit at long-on. He was halfway in and could n't pedal back to get under the lofted hit. Rahat went with one hand , but it was never going to be enough. In the end , he did n't even get a finger on it. If he was right back , it would 've been straight down his throat 87.1 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , defends it back to Hafeez 86.6 Babar to Siddle , no run , another forward defensive 86.5 Babar to Siddle , no run , lunges forward and defends to short cover Peter Siddle , right handed bat , comes to the crease 86.4 Babar to M Marsh , out Lbw ! ! Good review that. It pitched in line and went past the inside edge of Marsh who was lunging forward to defend , he missed and that would 've crashed into middle of middle. Erasmus thought about it and said no but then had to change his call. Pakistan get another one. M Marsh lbw b Babar 27 ( 61 ) [ 4s-2 ] Babar to M Marsh , THATS OUT ! ! Lbw ! ! Babar and Misbah have a chat and they decide to take the review against Marsh. It was for an lbw call. Not out is the original decision. Dad Geoff looks very nervous as the third ump is called for. OUT is the call as all three reds pop up on the tracker. Erasmus changes his decision and Geoff is a frustrated man. He made a gesture with his hand suggesting that his son should 've pushed forward and played with the bat , more with an intention to play 86.3 Babar to Johnson , 1 run , comes down the track and drives it hard to long-on Silly point moves into a leg slip now 86.2 Babar to Johnson , 2 runs , what was the need for that ? It was paddle-swept to fine leg and for some reason Johnson wants two. They hare back and it needed a full length dive from Johnson to make it in. The throw was n't direct on the stumps , which would 've sent the batsman back Three men around the bat for Babar 86.1 Babar to Johnson , no run , sharp turn in for Babar , Johnson misses the nudge to leg , straight off the pad and caught at short leg Zulfiqar Babar [ 20.0-2-63-1 ] is back into the attack 85.6 Hafeez to Johnson , 1 run , flighted delivery on off and middle , Johnson moves a little across and drives it to long-on 85.5 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , pitched on middle and leg , Johnson blocks 85.4 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , tossed up around off , Johnson looks to drive but a hint of turn beats him , the ball goes through and the keeper half-stops it , the ball goes towards Younis Khan at slip 85.3 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , flighted delivery that spins away from outside off , Johnson leaves 85.2 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , very full from Hafeez , Johnson squeezes it out back to the bowler 85.1 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , tossed up on middle , Johnson leans forward and defends 84.6 Imran Khan to M Marsh , no run , fullish delivery that jags back in a touch towards the batsman , Marsh gets behind the line and defends it into the off-side 84.5 Imran Khan to M Marsh , no run , short of a good length on middle , Marsh defends 84.4 Imran Khan to M Marsh , no run , fullish delivery around off , Marsh leans forward and drives it to mid-off , who has to dive to his left to collect the ball 84.3 Imran Khan to M Marsh , no run , a little fuller this time from Imran , Marsh leans forward and drives it to short cover 84.2 Imran Khan to M Marsh , no run , on a good length and on off , Marsh blocks with the full face of the bat 84.1 Imran Khan to M Marsh , no run , Marsh goes forward and softly drives it to mid-on 83.6 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , floated up on off , Johnson goes on the front foot and gently pushes it to short cover 83.5 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , drives this flighted delivery towards short cover 83.4 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , tossed up around off , Johnson leans forward and blocks it back to the bowler 83.3 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , another one that skids on with the angle , Johnson gets some part of the bat on it , the ball rolls away into the leg-side 83.2 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , leans forward and pushes it towards short cover 83.1 Hafeez to Johnson , no run , fullish delivery that skids on , Johnson misses to lay any bat onto it , the ball hits the front pad and the umpire gave it not out Pakistan has decided to review a lbw decision of Johnson. The onfield umpire gave it 'Not Out'. There is no problem with the front foot. Hawk-Eye shows that the ball was just clipping the leg stump. So , the onfield decision stays . Mohammad Hafeez [ 19.0-4-43-0 ] is back into the attack 82.6 Imran Khan to Johnson , 1 run , straying on the pads of the batsman , Johnson flicks it to deep square leg off his pads 82.5 Imran Khan to M Marsh , 1 run , short delivery from Imran , Marsh goes on the back foot and pulls it fine , he rolls his wrists over the ball , the ball goes to fine leg 82.4 Imran Khan to M Marsh , no run , bowls this one outside off , Marsh lets it go through 82.3 Imran Khan to M Marsh , no run , back of a length delivery on the pads , Marsh fails to clip this fine , the ball rolls away into the leg-side after hitting the pad , Johnson starts off from the non-striker 's end in search of a run but is sent back by Marsh , who shouts 'No' 82.2 Imran Khan to M Marsh , no run , fullish with a hint of shape in towards the batsman , Marsh drives it towards mid-on 82.1 Imran Khan to Johnson , 1 run , on a good length and just outside off , Johnson knocks it towards cover and sets off for a single 81.6 Rahat Ali to M Marsh , no run , on a good length and on the off stump , Marsh covers the line and defends 81.5 Rahat Ali to M Marsh , no run , on a good length and outside off , Marsh shoulders arms 81.4 Rahat Ali to M Marsh , no run , fullish delivery just around off , Marsh looks to drive and misses , he hits the pad with his bat and that 's the source of noise because of which the umpire gave him out Mitchell Marsh has been given out caught behind. He has decided to review the decision. There are no problems with the front foot. The onfield decision has been changed and Marsh survives . 81.3 Rahat Ali to M Marsh , no run , waste of a delivery. This one was full but was bowled down leg , Sarfraz moves to his left to collect it 81.2 Rahat Ali to M Marsh , FOUR , that was beautiful from Marsh , he reaches forward and drives this good length delivery through the cover-region. With this boundary , Australia have also avoided any chance of a follow-on 81.1 Rahat Ali to M Marsh , 2 runs , back of a length delivery on the pads , Marsh moves across and flicks it towards mid-wicket Rahat Ali [ 16.0-0-44-1 ] is back into the attack 80.6 Imran Khan to Johnson , no run , yorker just outside off , Johnson jams it out to point 80.5 Imran Khan to Johnson , no run , fuller and good shape on the that one , the ball shapes back in towards Johnson , who pushes at it with a full face of the bat Mitchell Johnson , left handed bat , comes to the crease Drinks are on the field now . 80.4 Imran Khan to Haddin , out Bowled ! ! That 's the first wicket for Imran Khan in Test cricket. Pakistan get the breakthrough with the new ball. It was fuller in length and pitched just outside off , Haddin went a little too hard at it , the ball shapes in a little , takes the inside edge and crashes into the off stump. Australia are in trouble now. Imran Khan was jubilant after taking this wicket. Haddin b Imran Khan 22 ( 46 ) [ 4s-2 6s-1 ] Imran Khan to Haddin , THATS OUT ! ! Bowled ! ! 80.3 Imran Khan to M Marsh , 1 run , on a good length and this time the ball shapes back in towards the batsman , Marsh works it to backward square leg There are three slips and a gully in place . 80.2 Imran Khan to M Marsh , no run , on a length and outside off , the ball shapes away as well , Marsh leaves it alone 80.1 Imran Khan to M Marsh , no run , on a good length and just outside off , Marsh allows it to go through to the keeper Imran Khan [ 12.0-2-37-0 ] is back into the attack The second new ball has been taken by Pakistan . 79.6 Babar to Haddin , no run , stays back in the crease and pushes it towards the mid-wicket region 79.5 Babar to Haddin , no run , Haddin tries to sweep this delivery on the leg-stump , he misses and the ball hits his pads , there was a half-appeal from the Pakistani players but the ball pitched outside leg 79.4 Babar to Haddin , no run , pads this one that turns back in from outside the leg-stump 79.3 Babar to Haddin , no run , shortish delivery on the stumps , Haddin turns it into the leg-side 79.2 Babar to M Marsh , 1 run , flatter and turns back in from outside leg , Marsh goes back in the crease and works it towards square leg 79.1 Babar to M Marsh , no run , flighted delivery on middle-stump , Marsh leans forward and blocks 78.6 Hafeez to Haddin , no run , lunges forward in defence 78.5 Hafeez to Haddin , no run , another one that 's a little short in length , Haddin goes on the back foot and punches it to mid-off 78.4 Hafeez to Haddin , no run , flattish and outside off , Haddin rocks back and defends 78.3 Hafeez to Haddin , no run , tossed up just outside off , Haddin leans forward and blocks 78.2 Hafeez to Haddin , no run , flighted delivery on off and middle , Haddin defends 78.1 Hafeez to Haddin , no run , shortish and on middle , Haddin stays on the back foot and turns it into the leg-side Mohammad Hafeez [ 18.0-3-43-0 ] is back into the attack 77.6 Babar to M Marsh , no run , works this flighted delivery towards short mid-wicket 77.5 Babar to M Marsh , no run , spins back in towards the batsman from outside leg , Marsh taps it gently into the leg-side 77.4 Babar to Haddin , 1 run , short and on the pads , Haddin clips it towards deep square leg 77.3 Babar to M Marsh , 1 run , tossed up on off , Marsh gently drives to mid-off 77.2 Babar to M Marsh , no run , another one that 's on leg , Marsh blocks 77.1 Babar to M Marsh , no run , bowls this one on leg from over the wicket , Marsh defends 76.6 Yasir Shah to M Marsh , 1 run , tossed up on off , Marsh drives it to mid-off for a single 76.5 Yasir Shah to M Marsh , no run , full and down leg , Marsh misses the glance and the keeper collects the ball 76.4 Yasir Shah to M Marsh , no run , flatter and just outside off , Marsh stays on the back foot and knocks it to short cover 76.3 Yasir Shah to M Marsh , no run , pushed through around off , Marsh blocks 76.2 Yasir Shah to Haddin , 1 run , loopy full toss from Shah , Haddin works it to long-on 76.1 Yasir Shah to Haddin , no run , flighted on off , Haddin presses forward in defence 75.6 Babar to M Marsh , no run , loopy delivery on off , Marsh leans forward and defends 75.5 Babar to M Marsh , no run , Babar bowls this one from over the wicket , Marsh goes on the front foot and blocks 75.4 Babar to M Marsh , no run , flighted outside off and spinning away from Marsh , Marsh moves across and pushes at it , the ball takes the outside half and dribbles away into the off-side 75.3 Babar to M Marsh , 2 runs , a little shorter and Marsh punches it back towards the bowler with some force , Babar does n't field the ball as he moved away and the ball goes straight down the ground , the batsmen take two 75.2 Babar to M Marsh , no run , defends it into the off-side 75.1 Babar to M Marsh , FOUR , great shot from Marsh.

Warner b Yasir Shah 133 ( 174 ) [ 4s-11 6s-2 ] Yasir Shah to Warner , THATS OUT ! ! Bowled ! ! 66.2 Yasir Shah to Warner , no run , pitched outside off and spins back in towards Warner , Warner defends from the crease 66.1 Yasir Shah to Warner , no run , tossed up around off , blocked back towards the bowler Yasir Shah will start off after lunch. He has a slip and a leg gully in place . Welcome back. The players are out in the middle . Amidst all this , Warner has batted through without putting a foot wrong. He has looked in no trouble at all and has taken the sensible approach to Test match batting curbing his natural instincts and treating the bowling on merit. Three consecutive tons in a row for him and he looks set for a big one. He is the one that his side would look to to get closer to the Pakistani total. The bowling has been good and the pitch is offering some assistance. Since the Friday prayers are scheduled , lunch break will be for an hour. Do join us then for some more engrossing long-form cricket. We will be back then and do enjoy whatever you are having ( food I meant ) . See you soon . So that 's two-and-a-half-hours of Test match cricket that one has witnessed. Must say Pakistan have made steady inroads into the Aussie batting line-up. They began the day with Rahat and Hafeez who built up the pressure and that paid dividends with Rogers ' wicket. Doolan got himself into a shell and then ran himself out. Clarke fell cheaply and just before lunch , Smith who was batting beautifully against the spinners found point with a cut shot. So four wickets in that session for Pakistan and that leaves the Test fascinatingly poised . 65.6 Babar to M Marsh , no run , turned to short leg and Marsh has seen that tricky over off. His dad Geoff lets out a huge grin who is a relieved man. It will be lunch on day 3 65.5 Babar to M Marsh , no run , that should relieve some pressure on Marsh , outside off , left alone 65.4 Babar to M Marsh , no run , almost carried back to the bowler. Marsh was looking to play slightly across the line , the soft leading edge though did n't carry to Babar 65.3 Babar to M Marsh , no run , pushed back to the bowler 65.2 Babar to M Marsh , no run , first ball that Marsh faces in Tests and he is back and across to defend Four men crowd the debutant Marsh. Good captaincy from Misbah. Babar to continue from round the wicket 65.1 Babar to Warner , 1 run , gets forward and drives to long-on for a comfortable single Zulfiqar Babar [ 14.0-2-48-1 ] is back into the attack Mitchell Marsh , right handed bat , comes to the crease 64.6 Yasir Shah to S Smith , out Caught by Hafeez ! ! Yasir Shah has his first Test wicket and he is running around in delight. That was n't a wicket-taking ball at all - short and wide , but the bounce did Smith there , who could n't keep his cut down , good catch by Hafeez at point. So a pretty soft dismissal in the end , but Pakistan will take it any day. S Smith c Hafeez b Yasir Shah 22 ( 44 ) [ 4s-3 ] Yasir Shah to S Smith , THATS OUT ! ! Caught ! ! 64.5 Yasir Shah to Warner , 1 run , a short-arm whip into the gap at mid-wicket. Easy single that A leg gully in place for Warner. Yasir Shah is coming from round the wicket now 64.4 Yasir Shah to S Smith , 3 runs , shortens the length outside off , Smith is onto it quickly and punches it into the gap at point. They run hard and come back for the third 64.3 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , uses his feet and defends to silly point , where Azhar Ali is sharp 64.2 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , edged but never looked like it will carry to YK at slip. Rolled to him in fact. Good bowling though from Yasir Shah for he got some turn on that delivery 64.1 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , gets forward to defend even though he is n't to the pitch of it 63.6 Hafeez to Warner , no run , turns across Warner who gets back to defend 63.5 Hafeez to Warner , no run , defended to the left of Hafeez 63.4 Hafeez to Warner , no run , driven to short cover 63.3 Hafeez to Warner , FOUR , back to back fours for Warner. This was short and allowed Warner to rock back to cut it wide of point. Smashed away. Poor bowling from the professor . 63.2 Hafeez to Warner , FOUR , fine punch off the back foot. Threaded the gap and the ball raced away. It was n't all that short , but Warner made his own room and put it away 63.1 Hafeez to Warner , no run , Warner decides to play that off the back foot and pushes it to short cover 62.6 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , a maiden over from Yasir Shah as Smith blocks one back to the bowler 62.5 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , shortish and that allows Smith to go on the back foot to block 62.4 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , opens the face of the bat to guide it to point 62.3 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , nearly chipped to short cover. Smith into the drive early and is lucky that it did n't carry 62.2 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , Smith is down the wicket , but the length is much shorter , so he has to block 62.1 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , floated up on the stumps , Smith defends Yasir Shah [ 5.0-0-26-0 ] is back into the attack 61.6 Hafeez to Warner , no run , another defensive shot , this time the ball rolls to point 61.5 Hafeez to Warner , no run , blocked back to the bowler 61.4 Hafeez to Warner , SIX , now Warner gets a boundary six. Is down the wicket and whipped powerfully over mid-on , it kept sailing and sailing and landed over the ropes at long-on. Went all the way. Hinto of aggression there from Warner 61.3 Hafeez to Warner , no run , that was in the air as Warner came forward to defend , but there is no silly point , so Warner gets away 61.2 Hafeez to Warner , no run , floated on the middle and leg , Warner blocks 61.1 Hafeez to Warner , no run , shortish on the stumps , Warner makes room and punches , but ca n't find the gap on the off-side Mohammad Hafeez [ 16.0-3-29-0 ] is back into the attack 60.6 Babar to S Smith , no run , Babar is plugging away on a length , Smith is content to defend once more 60.5 Babar to S Smith , no run , very full on the stumps , blocked to mid-on 60.4 Babar to S Smith , no run , lunges out to defend it back to the bowler 60.3 Babar to S Smith , FOUR , Smith is batting superbly against the spinners. Down the track and flicked over mid-wicket. Nicely done 60.2 Babar to Warner , 1 run , Warner opens the face of the bat and plays it into the gap at point. Turns the strike over 60.1 Babar to S Smith , 1 run , almost too close to the pitch of that delivery that time , yet Smith digs it out to long-off 59.6 Yasir Shah to Warner , no run , head over the ball and blocked back to the bowler 59.5 Yasir Shah to S Smith , 1 run , uses his feet and drives to long-off 'Another one before lunch guys ' is the call from Sarfraz behind the stumps 59.4 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , Smith now goes on the back foot to block that 59.3 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , driven to the left of Yasir Shah , who makes a half-stop , Misbah is there to cover up from short cover 59.2 Yasir Shah to S Smith , no run , leans forward to defend 59.1 Yasir Shah to Warner , 1 run , tries to manufacture a short-arm pull , but completely mistimes it , yet gets in the gap and gets to the other end 58.6 Babar to S Smith , no run , defended back to the bowler 58.5 Babar to S Smith , no run , back to more forward defensive practice for Smith 58.4 Babar to S Smith , no run , beautiful bowling from Babar. Does Smith with one that is bowled slower , loopier and beats the groping bat of the Aussie. Smith knows he has been comprehensively done there and acknowledges the delivery by nodding his head 58.3 Babar to Warner , 1 run , whipped wide of Misbah at short mid-wicket 58.2 Babar to Warner , no run , gets forward to block to the right of the bowler 58.1 Babar to Warner , 2 runs , worked off the back foot to deep backward square leg , Sarfraz is n't happy with the fielder for allowing the second.

Is down the pitch and onto the whip against the spin in a flash. The fast uncorking of the wrists sends the ball purring wide of mid-on Smith is now batting with the baggy green on. Good to see that . 57.1 Yasir Shah to Warner , 1 run , floated up from round the wicket , defended wide of point for a single Yasir Shah [ 3.0-0-19-0 ] is back into the attack 56.6 Babar to S Smith , no run , leans forward to block 56.5 Babar to Warner , 1 run , swept from the stumps to deep square leg , for a single 56.4 Babar to Warner , no run , pushed to the cover region 56.3 Babar to Warner , no run , good fielding from Younis at slip. Anticipates the reverse sweep and gets down low to his left to field. Gets the throw back in quickly too 56.2 Babar to Warner , no run , inside edge onto the pads as Warner looked to drive , no silly point so Warner gets away. It turned in sharply too 56.1 Babar to Warner , no run , flighted delivery outside off , defended back to Babar 55.6 Rahat Ali to S Smith , no run , full and outside off , Smith defends 55.5 Rahat Ali to S Smith , no run , worked to the right of short mid-wicket 55.4 Rahat Ali to S Smith , no run , on a length and outside off , angling away , left alone 55.3 Rahat Ali to Warner , 1 run , short of length outside off , punched to sweeper cover , takes another single 55.2 Rahat Ali to Warner , no run , tight line on off , Warner blocks solidly 55.1 Rahat Ali to Warner , no run , short and wide outside off , third time today that Warner has failed to nail the cut off Rahat Ali 54.6 Babar to S Smith , no run , very short and on the stumps , Smith gets back to defend 54.5 Babar to S Smith , no run , steps out , but is n't to the pitch , so blocks 54.4 Babar to S Smith , no run , immediately the next one is short , which allows Smith to go back to block 54.3 Babar to S Smith , FOUR , Smith looks to take the attack to the spinners. He once again uses his feet and drives wide of cover , got to the pitch and drove it well 54.2 Babar to S Smith , no run , Smith goes on the back foot to block 54.1 Babar to Warner , 1 run , floated outside off , Warner plays a soft drive wide of cover for an easy single Drinks once again. Pakistan have prised out a couple more wickets and have Australia in some sort of a pickle. Still Warner is there and he needs company from the rest. Good tight old-fashioned Test match bowling from Pakistan - nothing fancy and that is allowing the pressure to build . 53.6 Rahat Ali to S Smith , no run , pitched up and angled away from Smith , who lifts his bat and lets it go 53.5 Rahat Ali to S Smith , no run , whipped off the pads , wide of square leg , but no chance of a quick single as the fielder gets there 53.4 Rahat Ali to S Smith , no run , back to blocking is Smith 53.3 Rahat Ali to S Smith , no run , pitched well outside leg and that rules out the lbw. Smith shouldered arms to that and was hit on the thigh pad 53.2 Rahat Ali to S Smith , 2 runs , full and on the pads , flicked to deep square leg , for a couple of runs 53.1 Rahat Ali to S Smith , no run , swings back in into the right-hander , Smith covers the line to block 52.6 Babar to Warner , no run , forces Warner to go on the back foot to block 52.5 Babar to Warner , no run , uses his feet and blocks it back to Babar 52.4 Babar to Warner , 2 runs , takes it from middle and plays a pre-meditated paddle down to fine leg 52.3 Babar to Warner , no run , sharp turn in for Babar once more , has Warner in some strife as the batsman pushed forward to block. Hit on the body 52.2 Babar to S Smith , 3 runs , Smith uses his feet to his first delivery and whips this wide of mid-on. Rahat almost messes it up , but manages to keep it to a three Steven Smith , right handed bat , comes to the crease 52.1 Babar to Clarke , out Caught by Azhar Ali ! ! What a wicket that is for Pakistan. Nothing great about the delivery , it angled in towards leg stump , but Clarke got a big inside edge onto the pads as he looked to block , looped to Azhar at FSL. Easy catch and that 's the third one down. Clarke c Azhar Ali b Babar 2 ( 13 ) Babar to Clarke , THATS OUT ! ! Caught ! ! 51.6 Rahat Ali to Warner , no run , down leg and Warner ca n't connect with the glance 51.5 Rahat Ali to Clarke , 1 run , a very risky single that. Even a direct hit would n't have got Warner. He would 've just made it. It was Clarke 's call and Warner had to put on his skates to beat that throw from square leg 51.4 Rahat Ali to Clarke , no run , now the away swinger , Clarke watches it and lets it go 51.3 Rahat Ali to Clarke , no run , moved in late , but Clarke has covered it well and defends to mid-on 51.2 Rahat Ali to Warner , 1 run , pitched up outside off , a free flowing drive to sweeper cover 51.1 Rahat Ali to Warner , no run , short of length on off , solidly blocked by Warner 50.6 Babar to Clarke , no run , ooh - that turned from a length. On the middle and leg stump , turned across Clarke who went back to block 50.5 Babar to Clarke , no run , they thought about the review for an instant , then decided against it. Good move too. For Clarke was a long way out of his crease as he got struck on the pads. Erasmus made the right call 50.4 Babar to Clarke , no run , floated on off , defended back to the bowler 50.3 Babar to Clarke , no run , uses his feet and drives to mid-on 50.2 Babar to Clarke , no run , slightly quicker from Babar , Clarke blocks 50.1 Babar to Clarke , no run , works this to mid-on Three men around the bat for Clarke 49.6 Rahat Ali to Warner , no run , pitched up outside off , left alone 49.5 Rahat Ali to Warner , no run , presses forward and blocks it to mid-on with a full face of the bat 49.4 Rahat Ali to Warner , FOUR , poor delivery from Rahat Ali , he knows it and lets out a grunt. Down leg and that 's easily glanced away by Warner to the fine leg fence 49.3 Rahat Ali to Clarke , 1 run , late tail in for Rahat Ali , Clarke 's bat comes down late and that is enough for the inside edge to run away wide of square leg. He is off the mark with a streaky shot 49.2 Rahat Ali to Clarke , no run , short of length on the stumps , confidently blocked 49.1 Rahat Ali to Clarke , no run , oohs and aahs from the Pakistanis after Clarke inside-edges a drive onto the front pad Rahat Ali [ 12.0-0-34-1 ] is back into the attack Michael Clarke , right handed bat , comes to the crease 48.6 Babar to Doolan , out Doolan Run Out ! ! Block , block , block and finally a run-out. Miserable end to a pretty miserable innings from Doolan. He was feeling the pressure and has committed suicide. Tried to take on mid-on after playing it straight to the fielder , Warner was n't sure about the single , he even stopped for an instant , but Doolan ran through , could n't beat the direct hit by inches. The bat was on the line and the third ump sends Doolan on his way. A gift for Pakistan that. Doolan run out ( Rahat Ali ) 5 ( 34 ) Babar to Doolan , THATS OUT ! ! Run Out ! ! Has Doolan run himself out ? Looks like it. Misbah is all smiles. Third ump called for. Direct hit from Rahat. A very tight call. The bat looks to be on the line. OUT is the call and fair enough. The line belongs to the fielding side. What a waste of a wicket . 48.5 Babar to Doolan , no run , on the stumps , no room to work with , defended to Babar 48.4 Babar to Doolan , no run , uses his feet , but blocks again 48.3 Babar to Doolan , no run , takes a step out , but defends it back to Babar 48.2 Babar to Doolan , no run , angling in , worked to short leg once more 48.1 Babar to Doolan , no run , turned to short leg The ball has been put into those two large hoops , it passes the test and for now they are continuing with it 47.6 Imran Khan to Warner , no run , edged and does n't carry to slip. Unlucky for Imran Khan , produced the edge , but on this slow wicket it never looked like carrying 47.5 Imran Khan to Warner , no run , pitched up on off , driven firmly , but ca n't beat mid-off 47.4 Imran Khan to Warner , no run , Imran Khan comes round the wicket to this delivery and it nearly pays off. Warner flicks and almost finds short mid-wicket. Did n't carry though 47.3 Imran Khan to Warner , FOUR , there it is ! Third consecutive ton for Warner in Tests. Superb off-drive , wide of mid-off , he runs hard , but the ball has crossed the ropes. Off comes the helmet and a big grin on his face , followed by a huge leap. Trademark Warner celebration - seen it so many times before. Rod Marsh and the Australian contigent are all up on their feet to applaud the pocket rocket. Even does the baby cradle with his bat - that 's for the baby. Superb stuff ! 47.2 Imran Khan to Warner , no run , almost yorker length on the stumps , dug out to short cover 47.1 Imran Khan to Warner , no run , pitched up on off , Warner gets forward and pushes it softly to mid-off 46.6 Babar to Doolan , no run , worked to short mid-wicket From round the wicket now 46.5 Babar to Warner , 1 run , dragged down and drifting down leg , a half-pull/half-jab down to backward square leg , just the single though 46.4 Babar to Warner , no run , only Sarfraz appealed there. Not sure for what. Warner shuffled across to play a paddle sweep and missed , missed leg stump and nestled into the gloves of the keeper. Warner uncharacteristically is a bit iffy out there. Wants to get that hundred and is eager to do it quickly 46.3 Babar to Warner , no run , floated up on the stumps , flicked to short mid-wicket 46.2 Babar to Warner , no run , punched back to Babar as the bowler drags it a bit short 46.1 Babar to Warner , no run , that is a nervy shot. Wanted to manufacture a short-arm jab from outside off , but only gets an inside edge onto the pads 45.6 Imran Khan to Doolan , no run , on a length and outside off , left alone 45.5 Imran Khan to Doolan , no run , good delivery that , nearly opened up Doolan , who was looking to close the face on it , did n't do it and eventually plays it back to the bowler 45.4 Imran Khan to Doolan , no run , he is timing them sweetly , but finding the fielders. Straight to short cover 45.3 Imran Khan to Doolan , no run , pitched up on the stumps , nicely driven , but straight to the fielder at mid-on Two slips and a gully in for Doolan 45.2 Imran Khan to Doolan , 2 runs , the boundary riders are very slack. Once again the fielder was slow and by the time Babar fires in the return , Doolan has made it back for the second 45.1 Imran Khan to Warner , 1 run , shortish and outside off , cracked away , but there is a sweeper in place 44.6 Babar to Doolan , no run , now defended to the short mid-wicket fielder 44.5 Babar to Doolan , no run , floated outside off , Doolan blocks 44.4 Babar to Doolan , 2 runs , beautifully bowled by Babar , drifted in and took the soft outside edge , never looked like it would carry to slip , runs wide of YK and they take a couple of runs 44.3 Babar to Doolan , no run , tossed up around off , Doolan steps out of the crease and eases it towards mid-wicket 44.2 Babar to Doolan , no run , fullish on leg , Doolan pushes it into the leg-side 44.1 Babar to Doolan , no run , flatter around off , Doolan goes on the back foot and punches it to mid-on Zulfiqar Babar [ 5.0-0-25-0 ] is back into the attack That will be drinks on day 3. A very slow half session of play that. No boundaries scored so far today and even the normally aggressive Warner has been kept quiet by disciplined bowling from Pakistan. Rahat and Hafeez kept it tight and now Imran Khan is doing the same. Expect more of the same in the next half session too , unless Warner decides to go berserk . 43.6 Imran Khan to Warner , 2 runs , was a risky two , but the batsmen make it. It was pulled to the left of deep square , Warner always wanted two , Doolan was n't so sure , yet they take the fielder on , the throw is at the bowler 's end - on the bounce , by the time it is brought down onto the stumps , Doolan has made it easily. A sharp flat throw right above the bails would 've had Doolan in some strife 43.5 Imran Khan to Warner , no run , pushed off the front foot to cover 43.4 Imran Khan to Doolan , 1 run , that is very sloppy from Yasir Shah. He allows Doolan to get off the mark. It was a straightforward stop , but he takes his eyes off the ball at mid-off and fumbles , Doolan spots the chance and scampers across. Finally off the mark off his 16th delivery 43.3 Imran Khan to Doolan , no run , makes him come forward , Doolan plays an open-faced drive to point 43.2 Imran Khan to Doolan , no run , back of a length outside off , Doolan defends off the back foot to short cover 43.1 Imran Khan to Warner , 1 run , push-driven wide of mid-off , for a quick single 42.6 Hafeez to Doolan , no run , Doolan is still on 0 as he blocks once again 42.5 Hafeez to Doolan , no run , uses his feet , but can only defend it back to Hafeez 42.4 Hafeez to Doolan , no run , flicked to short mid-wicket 42.3 Hafeez to Warner , 3 runs , every now and then , Hafeez has been guilty of dragging it down , Warner lashes a cut through cover for three more runs 42.2 Hafeez to Warner , no run , now goes back to block as the length is short 42.1 Hafeez to Warner , no run , pushed to short cover 41.6 Imran Khan to Doolan , no run , ca n't find the gap , even though he has timed the drive well , finds short cover 41.5 Imran Khan to Doolan , no run , much better from Doolan. Gets a nice stride forward and blocks to the off-side 41.4 Imran Khan to Doolan , no run , pitched up outside off , a soft drive to cover 41.3 Imran Khan to Doolan , no run , Doolan is tentative. Beaten by Imran Khan now. Hint of away movement , Doolan could 've left it alone , but pushed out at it and is beaten 41.2 Imran Khan to Warner , 1 run , was there bat or glove on it ? The ump thought so and gave it as runs. Warner gets to the other end This fella - Imran Khan - reminds me a lot of Umar Gul. Those wrist bands , the little hop at the beginning of his run-up , before running in to bowl. Even the action looks similar to Gul 's. Similarly built too - lanky and wiry. Lots of similarities between the two . 41.1 Imran Khan to Warner , no run , fullish and on the stumps , defended to mid-on Imran Khan [ 6.0-1-23-0 ] is back into the attack 40.6 Hafeez to Warner , 1 run , now uses his feet and drives to long-off 40.5 Hafeez to Warner , no run , Hafeez is probing away , Warner is content to be patient and blocks 40.4 Hafeez to Warner , no run , now defended off the back foot as the length is short 40.3 Hafeez to Warner , no run , floated on middle and leg , defended back to the bowler 40.2 Hafeez to Warner , no run , cut straight to the fielder at cover , should 've been put away 40.1 Hafeez to Warner , no run , bat in front of the pad and defended to the left of the bowler 39.6 Rahat Ali to Doolan , no run , much better from Doolan. Sees the full length and the angle away , lifts his bat and lets it go 39.5 Rahat Ali to Doolan , no run , beaten ! On the angle. Pitches middle and tails away past the defensive stroke of the batsman. Doolan tried to cover the line , but the movement beat him 39.4 Rahat Ali to Warner , 1 run , looked like it came straight off the thigh pad , but Kettleborough reckons there was some glove on it , he gives it as runs. Replays prove him wrong 39.3 Rahat Ali to Warner , no run , pitched up on off , Warner plays a sweet drive , but straight to the fielder at mid-off 39.2 Rahat Ali to Warner , no run , definite reverse for Rahat Ali , tailed in late , but Warner plays a solid block back to him 39.1 Rahat Ali to Warner , 2 runs , full and down leg , flicked down to backward square leg , for a quick couple of runs 38.6 Hafeez to Doolan , no run , turned past short leg Now three men around the bat for Doolan 38.5 Hafeez to Warner , 1 run , uses his feet and flicks wide of short leg , gets off strike 38.4 Hafeez to Warner , no run , pitched on middle and spun past the back foot defensive of Warner , hit the pad , but it would 've gone down leg. So a good call not to take the review , even though the bowler and Misbah pondered about it Are Pakistan going for the review ? No ! They decide against it 38.3 Hafeez to Warner , no run , much fuller on the stumps , Warner defends it back to Hafeez 38.2 Hafeez to Warner , no run , lovely bowling from Hafeez , floated on middle and off , spinning away too , Warner opens the face of the bat to play to the off-side. Lots of oohs and aahs from the Pakistanis 38.1 Hafeez to Warner , no run , drifted in late from round the wicket , Warner pushes and gets a thick inside edge onto the pads 37.6 Rahat Ali to Doolan , no run , the tempter - full and wide outside off , Doolan leaves that 37.5 Rahat Ali to Doolan , no run , angling away from the right-hander , left alone Now two slips in place for the new batsman. Hint of reverse for Rahat Ali now 37.4 Rahat Ali to Doolan , no run , defended to short mid-wicket Alex Doolan , right handed bat , comes to the crease 37.3 Rahat Ali to Chris Rogers , out Bowled ! ! Rahat Ali breaks through. Relief for Pakistan. Rahat Ali roars in delight after bowling Chris Rogers. It nipped back in and cramped the batsman for room who was looking to play an ambitious cut - the inside edge clattered into the stumps. Chris Rogers put his head back in disappointment after the ball hit the stumps. Chris Rogers b Rahat Ali 38 ( 130 ) [ 4s-1 ] Rahat Ali to Chris Rogers , THATS OUT ! ! Bowled ! !

Pitch report : There is a bit of rough and 'there is some hope for the spinners on this pitch ' says Mushy. More about the discussion of what line and length to bowl on this pitch rather than talking about the pitch are Rameez Raja and Mushtaq Ahmed . Will Australia be able to score big in their first innings ? Or will Pakistan strike to dismantle the Australian batting line up ? All answers coming up in a short while. Stay tuned.. . Pakistan 's batting finally clicked yesterday. After two centuries and three well-compiled fifties from their batsmen , it was the bowlers ' chance to turn on the heat on the Australian batsmen. However , when Australia came out to bat in the final session , Warner was belligerent in his display of strokeplay. For most part of his innings of 75 , Warner had more runs than balls. If Warner goes on to complete his century , this will be his third Test century on the trot. On the other hand , Chris Rogers has occupied one end and is not giving anything away to the Pakistani bowlers. Pakistan had only one real chance of taking a wicket and that was when Younis Khan dropped Rogers at first slip. With the sun beating down , Pakistan will look to cash in on a pitch that 's offering enough turn to keep the spinners interested. Hello and Welcome to Day 3 of the first Test between Pakistan and Australia . Overall , it has been an entertaining day. Pakistan , however , will require early wickets tomorrow to not let the game fizzle into a tame draw. That 's all we have from here. Join us tomorrow for all the action on Day 3. Till then , have a nice day ahead.. . Day 2 , Stumps : Good job by Australia , they have done well to end the day on a high.

Join us in a short while for all the action.. . Welcome to Day 2 of the first Test between Pakistan and Australia being played at Dubai. Yesterday both teams shared honours at the end of day one. While Australia began in a fantastic fashion to leave Pakistan struggling at 7/2 ; an inspired performance from Younis Khan stabilized the Pakistani innings. The good news for the hosts is that Misbah is still out there. He can be very resilient and if he decides to stay out there , we could be in for a very long day . Will Pakistani batsmen continue to fight and be able to post a respectable total ? Or will Australian bowlers bring about their downfall ? Join us tomorrow for Day 2. Till then , take care . Australia will be a little disappointed with how things are at the moment. They would have hoped for more wickets after Pakistan were struggling in the first session. Mitchell Johnson was the pick of the bowlers , picking up three wickets. He was well supported by all the other bowlers , who kept a lid on the batsmen. The last over of the day from Lyon showed us how spin will play a very important role tomorrow onwards . So , Pakistan end Day 1 on 219/4. They would be happy with this score after they were left reeling at 7/2 in the first session. Younis Khan was the star batsman today , becoming only the 12th batsman in Test history to score a century against all the Test playing nations. He was well supported by Azhar Ali , who chipped in with a hard fought 53. Ali and Younis combined for a crucial 108-run third wicket stand and helped Pakistan recover to a certain extent . 89.6 Lyon to Shafiq , no run , another huge appeal from Lyon and the close-in fielders. The umpire ruled it 'Not Out'. Clarke and Haddin are pondering over a review but they decide against it. It was a flighted delivery outside off that turned back sharply towards the batsman , Shafiq did n't offer a shot and that 's why there was a loud appeal. Replays showed that the ball was just about going to clip the off-stump. This meant that the on-field decision would not have been over-ruled and Australia did the right thing to not review it 89.5 Lyon to Shafiq , no run , charges down the track and pushes it in front of the bowler 89.4 Lyon to Shafiq , no run , good spin on this delivery , it was turning back in towards Shafiq as he leaned forward , the ball hits the pad but the impact was outside off , Australia lose their first review Australia have decided to review a lbw decision. Shafiq was given 'Not Out ' by the onfield umpire. There are no problems with Lyon 's front foot.

Pakistan in trouble straightaway ! Both the openers are back into the hut. What a start for Australia. It was a back of a length delivery that jagged back in , Shehzad moved too far across in his crease and looked to work it to the on-side , the ball brushes the thigh pad and crashes into the leg-stump. Siddle is ecstatic and he has every right to be. That was a fantastic ball. Ahmed Shehzad b Siddle 3 ( 9 ) Siddle to Ahmed Shehzad , THATS OUT ! !

Brilliant inswinging yorker by Johnson , that ! Hafeez has absolutely no idea how to play it. He looked to flick it to the on-side , the yorker curled in and struck him right on the boot. He should not have asked for a review. That was as plumb as it could get. Hafeez lbw b Johnson 0 ( 2 ) Johnson to Hafeez , THATS OUT ! ! Lbw ! ! The umpire has given Hafeez LBW. He is not convinced and has asked for a review. No problem with Mitch 's no-ball. There is no bat involved either. A waste of review , really.

Three slips , a gully and a FSL in place to assist him . Teams : Australia ( Playing XI ) : Chris Rogers , David Warner , Alex Doolan , Michael Clarke ( c ) , Steven Smith , Mitchell Marsh , Brad Haddin ( w ) , Mitchell Johnson , Peter Siddle , Steve O'Keefe , Nathan Lyon Pakistan ( Playing XI ) : Ahmed Shehzad , Mohammad Hafeez , Azhar Ali , Younis Khan , Misbah-ul-Haq ( c ) , Asad Shafiq , Sarfraz Ahmed ( w ) , Zulfiqar Babar , Imran Khan , Yasir Shah , Rahat Ali Michael Clarke : " I think the pitch is very good. Maybe a bit slower than we are used to in Australia but it should be good. UAE has been great for us. We wanted to give some youngsters a chance. Mitch Marsh and Steve O'Keefe make their debuts. Very excited to see how they perform. It is always a special feeling to welcome new people in the team. " Misbah-ul-Haq : " We will bat first. The pitch looks a little bit dry. Maybe later on it will assist spin. Imran Khan and Yasir Shah are making their debut. It is a big series and the boys are ready to show their game. I am feeling confident and I am happy about how our preparations have gone. " Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to bat Pitch Report : " No grass on the pitch. There are a lot of cracks. It is absolutely flat and rock hard. This is a kind of pitch that if you bat first , you will make a lot of runs. The wicket is an absolute belter. Whoever makes more runs in their first innings , is likely to win the match , " reckons Dean Jones . The last time Australia and Pakistan faced each other in Tests was in 2010 , when they played a two-match series in England. Both teams managed to win a Test each. Pakistan would want nothing more than to begin this series on a positive note. Will they be able to turn things around in this format ? Toss and teams coming up in a short while. Stay tuned.. . On the other hand , Australia are on a roll. They held their nerve in the final ODI to effect a 3-0 clean sweep against the struggling Pakistanis. They will be boosted by the return of their skipper Michael Clarke. Most of their batsmen are in terrific form and the bowling looks intimidating , as usual. Steve O'Keefe and Mitchell Marsh are making their Test debuts today. Dean Jones presented O'Keefe with the cap while in Mitch 's case , the honours were done by his father Geoff Marsh . Ten days after a humiliating 3-0 whitewash in the ODI series , Pakistan will now be facing Australia in the first Test being played at Dubai. It is a tricky situation for them. Their fans have lost faith in their ability to bounce back and it will take more than just a one-off win to pacify the critics. Missing the services of Saeed Ajmal , Wahab Riaz , and Junaid Khan ; Pakistan will take solace in the fact that Younis Khan , Mohammad Hafeez , Zulfiqar Babar and Taufiq Umar have returned to the Test squad . Preview by Pradeep Pakistan began life without Saeed Ajmal in the ODI series against Australia and were promptly whitewashed by a 3-0 margin. The two teams have now switched gears , from coloured clothing to whites. The demands of a Test match is even more when compared to that of ODIs. Pakistan has been overly dependent on Ajmal in recent times , and his absence leaves a big hole to fill . On the other hand , Australia have had a great run in Tests and have reclaimed the number one ranking , thanks to their stunning victory against England at home , followed by the 2-1 series win against South Africa away. The challenge against Pakistan is different. They will be up against an attack loaded with spin and on surfaces that are alien to their own. Australia 's last visit to Asia ended in disaster , but under Darren Lehmann , Michael Clarke 's men have ticked all boxes . Pakistan Turmoil is the only word that can best describe Pakistan 's cricket at the moment. Already struggling without Ajmal , Pakistan lost the services of both Junaid Khan and Wahab Riaz to injuries. In a strange move , the selectors left out experienced left-arm spinner , Abdul Rehman , leaving the bowling attack short of experience and class. The Pakistan selectors have re-affirmed their faith in youth , and there has been maiden international call-ups for leg-spinner , Yasir Shah , and pace bowler , Imran Khan . Zulfiqar Babar returns to the Test squad while Mohammad Hafeez is back after passing a fitness test. There are not many changes in the batting line-up , although middle-order batsman , Umar Akmal , continues to remain ignored. Younis Khan is back despite his recent outbursts against the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) , following his exclusion from the ODI team . Australia If Pakistan have had their share of injury-related worries , the visitors have been buoyed by the prospect of their skipper , Michael Clarke , returning. All-rounder , Mitchell Marsh , who was tipped to make his Test debut , has recovered nicely from his hamstring strain and is likely to take the number six slot. The rest of the batting line-up has settled itself nicely , although Clarke would have been slightly concerned at their toothless display in the four-day practice match against Pakistan 'A' . With spin expected to play a big role , Steve O'Keefe is likely to partner Nathan Lyon as the second spinner. With Mitchell Johnson and Peter Siddle guaranteed selections , the bowling looks settled for the moment. David Warner was rested from the practice game as a precautionary measure and should return at the top of the order. Alex Doolan was impressive in the practice match , making a composed hundred , and should edge Phil Hughes for the final batting spot . Pitch Pakistan coach , Waqar Younis , had insisted on a dry pitch and should be happy with the look of the square. The spinners should come into play early on and there will be reverse swing on offer . Quotes I think that 's our greatest challenge , the fact that the wickets are so much slower than what we 're used to in Australia - Michael Clarke recognizes the challenge lying ahead for his team .
