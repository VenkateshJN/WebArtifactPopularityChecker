( PTI Photo ) RELATED BANGALORE : An elated Kolkata Knight Riders captain Gautam Gambhir said that the triumph was even sweeter as not many people gave them a chance after the first seven matches in IPL this year . " Where we were after first seven games , not many people thought we would be here , " Gambhir said on Sunday. " Boys absorbed a lot of pressure , a lot of credit needs to go to the team , " the team man in Gambhir came to the fore once again . Gambhir said that they always fancied the chance to win as Chinnaswamy is a small ground to defend . " This is a ground where it is very difficult to defend. We wanted to get it down to 5 overs , 50 or 60 to get. Manish played a fantastic innings , Yusuf chipped in , and Chawla hit that important six. Wriddhiman also played an unbelievable innings but Manish was fearless. " Man-of-the-match Pandey said that winning IPL was like " icing on the cake " after winning Ranji Trophy , Irani Trophy and Vijay Hazare Trophy . " We have got four achievements , Ranji Trophy , Irani , cherry on the cake was the IPL , " Pandey said . The man who hit 94 off 50 balls said that he was confident of performing in a crunch game . " I 'm very optimistic , and I love to play the crunch game. We got 10 in the first over , and that was the time I thought , if we kept doing that , we 'll get 200. " " Orange Cap ' winner Robin Uthappa described the feeling as " surreal " . " I 'm at a loss for words. I 'm happy I 've contributed in a meaningful manner. If I have to pick one innings , the one against Mumbai Indians , because I played with a broken toe , and I broke through a physical barrier.
