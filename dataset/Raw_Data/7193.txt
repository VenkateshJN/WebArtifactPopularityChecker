A look at the most productive bowling combinations in Tests shares 27 McGrath and Warne In the 104 Tests they played together , Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne came closer than any other pair to cracking 1000 wickets : in 197 innings , they collected 980. It was an irresistible combination - a metronomic fast bowler , and probably the greatest legspinner of them all - which did much to preserve Australia 's near-invincibility during their brilliant careers . Muralitharan and Vaas It 's no surprise to find Muttiah Muralitharan high on this list : in 163 innings together , the rubbery-wristed offspinner and his left-arm henchman Chaminda Vaas claimed 879 wickets. These two also top the list in one-day internationals , with 704 wickets together ( second are Murali and Sanath Jayasuriya , with 633 ) . It 's easy to overlook the sustained excellence of Vaas , who carried Sri Lanka 's seam attack for years : he finished with 355 Test wickets , and exactly 400 in ODIs . Ambrose and Walsh The first new-ball partnership on this list , and one which probably still gives Mike Atherton nightmares. Ambrose and Walsh took 757 wickets in partnership , more than 200 clear of any other opening pair. Both of them dismissed the luckless Atherton 17 times in Tests. The record is 19 , the number of times Glenn McGrath nabbed... Atherton . Wasim and Waqar Another new-ball pairing any captain would give his eye teeth for : Wasim Akram , left-arm and waspishly quick , and Waqar Younis , blisteringly fast with a toe-crushing yorker - " Waqared " entered the sport 's vocabulary after just a few of his indipping specials. They took 555 wickets in just 107 Test innings together ( Ambrose and Walsh , above , took 757 in 173 ) , and lie third on the ODI list , with 581 . In 104 Tests , McGrath and Warne collected nearly 1000 wickets together © Getty Images Anderson and Broad The highest current pairing on the list , with power to add : James Anderson and Stuart Broad have so far taken 519 wickets in 124 innings together - most , but not quite all , as a new-ball partnership. It 's still a bit of a shock to realise that the baby-faced Broad has already racked up 264 Test wickets , a number exceeded by only five other England bowlers ( including Anderson , 380 in 99 matches to date ) . Kallis and Ntini A slight surprise , perhaps , that this is South Africa 's highest-ranking pair : but Makhaya Ntini did take 390 wickets in his 101 Tests , and for almost all of those Jacques Kallis was doing his fair share of bowling. Their combined total is 502 , in 159 innings together . Kumble and Harbhajan The first spin combination on this list , Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh shared 501 wickets in just 99 innings with their bouncy mix of skiddy legbreaks and topspinners , and crafty jagging offspin. In all , they took over 1000 Test wickets between them. Kumble is also sixth on the ODI list , sharing 453 wickets with Javagal Srinath . Kallis and Pollock It 's that man Jacques again : he and Shaun Pollock scalped 501 victims in 148 innings together. Kallis is likely to go down in history as a rock-solid batsman , but his bowling was also seriously dependable ( and , when the mood took him , seriously fast ) . He ended up with 292 Test wickets , to set alongside 13,289 runs , and the little matter of 200 catches . Anderson and Broad : the current bowling pair are No. 5 on the all-time list © Getty Images Ntini and Pollock Another South African pairing , Ntini and Pollock shared 487 Test wickets in 119 innings together. Pollock ( 421 ) and Ntini ( 390 ) currently occupy the top two positions on their country 's wicket-taking lists - but Dale Steyn ( 383 ) is likely to change that very , very soon . McGrath and Gillespie Glenn McGrath did n't just operate in tandem with Shane Warne : for a long time he shared the new ball for Australia with Jason Gillespie , whose flowing black hair contrasted well with McGrath 's sandy neat short back and sides. They shared 479 wickets in 110 innings . Botham and Willis Thirty years ago they 'd have been top of this list : but such is the proliferation of modern-day Test cricket that Ian Botham and Bob Willis only just sneak into 11th place now. They shared 476 wickets in 105 innings together , although their most famous double act came at Headingley in 1981 , when Willis mopped Australia up with 8 for 43 after Botham had demoralised them with the bat .
