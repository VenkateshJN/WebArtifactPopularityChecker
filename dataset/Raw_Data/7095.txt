ODI # 3533 Profile Bhuvneshwar Kumar , like the other wily Kumar , Praveen , comes from Meerut , a northern Indian town known for - among other things - the industrial production of sports goods , most famously those under the brand SG. No wonder then that once thrown the new SG ball , Bhuvneshwar can make it hoop around corners , mostly back into the right-hand batsman but he gets it to hold its line often enough to be a genuine threat. Like the other Kumar , though , Bhuvneshwar operates at a middling pace of early 130s , but India were n't spoilt enough for choices to deny him an international debut season at the age of 22 , in late 2012. Bhuvneshwar said a roaring hello to international cricket. In his first international over , he bowled Nasir Jamshed ; with his first ODI delivery , he bowled Mohammad Hafeez ; and in his first Test series he played a part in India 's first whitewash of a four-Test series. Apart from the swing , Bhuvneshwar 's control of it and his cricketing smartness stand out. It stood out the time when he , as a 19-year-old , worked Sachin Tendulkar over for his first first-class duck in Indian domestic cricket.
