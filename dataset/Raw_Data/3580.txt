According to ESPNcricinfo , the " ideas are included in a discussion document which details radical suggestions for change " in the domestic and international game . They form part of a wide-ranging review into the future of English cricket , both domestically and internationally. Such changes , if proposed , would have to undergo an extensive discussion process within the ICC if they were eventually to be adopted . " Influence ICC - ECB President changing the World Cup format to a 40-over competition , " the document proposes according to the cricket website . Reduction in the five-day format would mean deviating from a tradition that has been there for more than 30 years. Tests have routinely been played over five days since 1979 , an exception being when India met West Indies over six days in Kanpur . The document includes a section suggesting the new president of the England and Wales Cricket Board - the former chairman , Giles Clarke - can use his influence at the ICC to bring change . Clarke remains the ECB 's representative at the ICC and is believed to retain ambitions of one day chairing the organisation. India , England and Australia also now have widespread powers to run the international game much as they see fit .
