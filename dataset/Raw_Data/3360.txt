Cricket Australia high performance chief Pat Howard said that the clip-on attachment , manufactured by British company Masuri , is made of honeycomb plastic and foam and offers protection to the exposed back of the neck , the area where Hughes was hit in November last year . Howard said that Masuri invested 240 hours of development time into " StemGuard " . " It 's really quite innovative and some players have seen the footage and are very receptive to trying it , " he explained . " It 's got impact protection and comes down the side of the head. Players will be given an opportunity to try it out in a game outside an international , but work our way up. " Howard said Cricket Australia is working with the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) to ensure helmet standards set by the British Standards Institute are adopted worldwide . Test player Hughes , 25 , was wearing an outdated helmet when he was knocked unconscious by a bouncer and collapsed while batting for South Australia against New South Wales in Sydney on November 25 . He died two days later from bleeding on the brain , plunging the cricket world into mourning . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
