Then A3,B4 and B3,A4 play pre quarter finals , the winners of those matches play A2 and B2 in quarter finals and the winners then play A1 and B1 in semifinals. This makes the group games very important and it means less knockout games to win the world cup based on how you perform . on February 22 , 2015 , 16 : 37 GMT @ Sira well I do agree that the worldcup is just the place for the best teams to be around and the top 8 clearly should play but seeing the improvement in teams like ireland and bangladesh in particular , it is not unfair. For me Ireland beating a test playing nation or Bangladesh winning against the top 8 teams is not an upset anymore. as spectators we have seen them win and even progress to the upper rounds for a number of world cups. Imagine if these teams played regular ODI 's with the proper teams and were given more exposure in the last 5-6 years then m sure there would be at least 10 top teams not 8. So i think this current format is good but I think the format of the 2011 world cup was ideal for even smaller teams to win just one game and upset the balance like how ireland and bangladesh did in the 2011 WC . on February 22 , 2015 , 16 : 16 GMT The format should be : The top 8 teams play one another. That is 28 matches. The next 6 teams play one another. That is 15 matches. The top 6 of the first group and the top 2 of the second group play the quarter finals , semis and finals. 7 matches. For a total of 50 matches. That is just one match more than what the current format has . Popular Videos
