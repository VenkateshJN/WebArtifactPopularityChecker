( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 NEW DELHI : While the cricket critics have their eyes trained on Virat Kohli 's movement outside the off stump against the fast bowlers , the batsman himself is n't losing much sleep over the issue. For him it is more important to not get bogged down against the spinners during the upcoming ODI series against Sri Lanka . In fact , the designated Team India captain for the series has spent good four days in Delhi practising on slow and turning pitches . " He went to Mumbai to practice with the India 'A ' team which played the warm-up game against Sri Lanka on Thursday. Prior to that , he practised at his academy on slow turning pitches , against a lot of spinners , " Virat 's childhood coach Rajkumar Sharma told TOI on Friday . Interestingly , the Delhi team for the Vijay Hazare trophy was also practising at the Ferozeshah Kotla but Virat opted instead to hone his skills at his academy with his coach . The sight of Moeen Ali running through the Indian team during the England tour had a lot of people rubbing their eyes in disbelief . " He is n't worried about his performances in England . He has scored against seamers all over the world. He is just focusing on the next series against Sri Lanka. They have good spinners and are a strong team in the sub-continent conditions. The century in the last ODI against West Indies has given Virat a lot of confidence. He just does n't want to let the good form slip , " said Sharma . He added : " He has made a plan to work on a few things before going to the World Cup. Preparing against spinners is just part of it.
