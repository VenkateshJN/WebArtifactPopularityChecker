In T20 , you have to use variation : Faulkner Jaipur , Thu , Apr 09 2015 by Saibal Bose Last updated on Thursday , 09 April , 2015 , 09 : 23 AM James Faulkner arrived as a raw talent at Rajasthan Royals in 2013 The Rajasthan Royals allrounder played a key role in Australia 's World Cup triumph Faulkner owes it to the Rajasthan Royals for giving him regular games to perform to his potential. © BCCL Australian James Faulkner arrived in the IPL 2013 as a raw , unknown bowler. Since then , his graph has seen a steady rise. This year , the Rajasthan Royals allrounder played a key role in Australia 's World Cup triumph. He spoke to TOI about his journey in the past three years. Excerpts : You use the slower ball quite often. Are n't you afraid batsmen will get used to it ? I think it 's like anything else that the batsmen play. They obviously get used to some deliveries , so you have to adapt with different kinds of slower balls and different tactics. It 's about trying to get better in both aspects of batting and bowling . Which was your favourite wicket in the World Cup final ? Personally , probably it was getting ( Corey ) Anderson out with the second ball. He can be as destructive as can be and it was a big wicket getting him . What did you tell Grant Elliot after you dismissed him ? I told him 'well played ' and that I was going to enjoy an early dinner ( laughs ) . How important has your stint in Royals been in becoming a household name ? This is my third year with the Royals. The Royals gave me a great opportunity to get involved in the IPL. Royals backed me , gave me consistent games and I performed well . Any strategies for bowling on flat Indian wickets ? It 's T20 cricket , full stop. No matter where you are playing and in what conditions , you have to use variations to challenge the batsmen. At the end of the day , T20 is all about the batters and the fours and sixes. You have to look to restrict that , take some wickets and you are going to do well . © TNN
