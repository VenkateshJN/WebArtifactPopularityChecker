Full coverage : ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 Pakistan eventually won the match by 29 runs on the Duckworth-Lewis method after South Africa collapsed to 202 all out from 33.3 overs. They lost an earlier group game to India by 130 runs . It was also the second match in a row at Eden Park to be dominated by the bowlers after last weekend 's epic one wicket win by New Zealand over co-hosts Australia . " It was a disappointing loss once again , " de Villiers told reporters. " We did n't have good enough partnerships. I think Pakistan wanted it more than us " De Villiers said he had not felt any energy from his team before the match . " I did n't feel any electric vibe , " he said. " It 's my responsibility to get the guys going which I did n't. They were n't prepared to fight . " I firmly believe there 's nothing wrong with the batting lineup , nothing wrong with the cricket team. I do n't feel there any scars. " De Villiers said he also believed his team should have been able to chase down 300 on Saturday , despite rain interruptions which freshened the pitch for the Pakistan fast bowlers . " There was a bit of juice there , " he said. " But there were too many soft dismissals. I 've just got nothing good to say about our performance today . " I 'm still excited about the ability of the players around me. I know we can win the World Cup.
