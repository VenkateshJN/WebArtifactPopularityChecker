Agreeing that IPL has gone through some " unfortunate " incidents , Dravid said while a system has been put in place in the T20 league by the authorities to guide the players to stay away from those corrupting the game , it should be replicated when they are not part of the IPL franchise teams . " There have been some unfortunate incidents relating to IPL. But there have been such incidents in cricket as a whole and IPL can not be seen in isolation. IPL attracts a lot of hype , media attention and wrong elements as well. We have to be vigilant at all times . " We have the system , the education programme and everyone is making an effort. We have to recognise that there are undesirable elements who want to come into the game . " One of the important things Is that IPL is just for two months and at other times the players are away from franchises. Things like education and vigilance need to be followed by not only IPL but others too , " said Dravid .
