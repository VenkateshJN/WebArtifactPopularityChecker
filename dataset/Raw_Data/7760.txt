Hira 's 170 hands Canterbury big win Ireland falls short by 117 runs in World Cup Associate Warm-up Match Share this article : After beginning innings on high , Ireland falls short by 117 runs . A phenomenal batting effort highlighted by a century from Ronnie Hira and then some clinical bowling helped Canterbury to a convincing 117-run win over Ireland XI in the ICC Cricket World Cup Associate Warm-up Match on Tuesday ( October 21 ) at Bert Sutcliffe Oval in Lincoln . Opting to bat , an opening stand of 193 between Henry Nicholls and Hira set up Canterbury ’ s innings as it ended on a mammoth 382 for 6. In reply , Ireland had a century-run opening stand , but then lost wickets in big chunks to be bowled out for 265 in 48 overs . Earlier , after a first-wicket partnership with Nicholls ( 71 off 77 ) , Hira shared a 100-run stand for the second wicket with Peter Fulton , the captain , on his way to a brilliant 170 off 129 balls – with 22 fours and four sixes – before retiring hurt. Fulton went on to score a half-century before being dismissed in the 47th over , but not before Canterbury was in a commanding position . Ireland began its innings well with Andy Balbirnie ( 55 ) and Niall O ’ Brien ( 55 ) putting on 112 runs for the opening stand. Will Williams then instigated a collapse as Ireland slipped from 111 for no loss to 125 for 4 in a matter of five overs . Andrew Ponyter held the innings together with a solid 57 , sharing partnerships with the middle and lower order , but once he was dismissed by Kyle Jamieson in the 44th over , Ireland was left with too much to do. Williams finished the innings with three wickets , while McCone picked up two . To see the scorecard and review the Canterbury v Ireland XI match in full , please click here . Share this article :
