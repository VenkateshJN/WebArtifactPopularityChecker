Seven magnificent IPL moments and one ugly truth Avijit Ghosh Avijit Ghosh,TNN | May 8 , 2014 , 12.16 PM IST Kieron Pollard of the Mumbai Indians looses his temper during an IPL 7 match against Royal Challengers Bangalore in Mumbai. ( PTI Photo ) RELATED NEW DELHI : In the hullabaloo of an acrimonious election often resembling low theatre , the ongoing IPL has n't captured popular imagination to the same degree as before. Nonetheless , this edition too has been marked by a high percentage of thrills and spills. A selection of some unforgettable moments as IPL 7 approaches midway.. . 1. APRIL 18 , ABU DHABI : CSK VS KXIP ARRIVAL OF THE MAX FACTOR 205 runs should be a winning score in T20 , especially when you are also the finest fielding side in the league. But KXIP 's Glen Maxwell ( 95 off 43 balls ) made the target look ridiculously insufficient. It was n't a Mad Max act - the Mumbai Indian discard struck only two sixes - rather an exhibition of hard running and deft placements. The crowd went wild and co-owner Preity Zinta wilder. The knock heralded the arrival of IPL 7 's premier eyeball grabber . 2. APRIL 24 : SHARJAH : KKR VS RCB CHRIS LYNN 'S SENSATIONAL CATCH TO DISMISS AB DE VILLIERS RCB needed a six to win and De Villiers ' hit seemed to sail over long on. But Lynn soared like a hawk , swallowed the catch airborne and collapsed on the ground as if felled by a gunshot. Only professors of physics can explain why the Queenslander did n't fall over the ropes. This is one man-ofthe-match winning catch thousands will keep returning to on youtube . 3. APRIL 28 , DUBAI : KINGS XI PUNJAB VS RCB STARC CATCHING BLINDERS IN THE DEEP Within minutes of each other , Mitchell Starc took two exceptional catches near the deep square leg boundary. First , the Oz pacer ran to his left and held on to a slog sweep by Wriddhiman Saha without letting the shot 's velocity push him beyond the ropes. Moments later , he dived to pounce a Maxwell mishit. Sheer magic ! 4. APRIL 28 , DUBAI : RCB VS KXIP SANDEEP SHARMA CLEAN BOWLS CHRIS GAYLE Last season , Chris Gayle had terrorised bowlers. This year he has n't been at his intimidating best. But on April 28 , the West Indian looked like getting his mojo back as he smote Maxwell for two sixes and two fours in the game 's first over. Sharma was next change ; a typical David vs Goliath tussle. Gayle charged at him , played the wrong line and was bowled. The 20-year-old from Patiala had faced the firing squad and survived. He also became a hero . 5. APRIL 29 , ABU DHABI : RR VS KKR STEVE SMITH 'S SMART BLOCK-AND RUN TACTICS IN THE ELIMINATOR 'S LAST BALL It 's the last ball and RR need two to win. But it was n't as easy as the equation. Striker Smith had n't been able to read KKR 's Sunil Narine , the meanest slow bowler in business. A big shot was risky. So the quick-thinking Aussie immediately conjured an idea breathtaking in simplicity : just block and run. As per plan , Smith pushed the ball gently to deep cover and the two Aussies - captain Shane Watson at the other end - sprinted to victory . 6. MAY 4 , B'LORE : RCB VS SRH AB DE VILLIERS PUMMELS DALE STEYN Watching a great fast bowler in action always thrills. To find him confronted with one of world 's most inventive batters is a spectator 's dream. On the day , the batter won : De Villiers toyed with Steyn , treating him like a medium pacer , and hammered him for two fours and two sixes. Even Steyn clapped . 7. MAY 5 , AHMEDABAD : KKR VS RR KKR 'S COLLAPSE FROM 121 FOR NO LOSS TO 123 FOR 6 IN EIGHT BALLS It looked like openers Robin Uthappa and captain Gautam Gambhir had put KKR on a winning course when Watson claimed three in the 15th. Then leg-break bowler Pravin Tambe scalped a hat-trick in the 16th as KKR gave new meaning to the word 'implode' . THE UGLY TRUTH MAY 6 , MUMBAI : MI VS RCB THE POLLARD-STARC FACE-OFF Kieron Pollard throwing his bat at Mitchell Starc - long after all the breathtaking shots played by AB De Villiers in this edition are forgotten , this ugly moment of IPL 7 will endure.
