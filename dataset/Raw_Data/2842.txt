" He will be attending the BCCI AGM as an MCA representative. We have already sent his name to the BCCI , " MCA sources said . Pawar , who headed the Board from 2005-08 was also the ICC chief from 2010-12 , had earlier in the day said that he was n't too eager to contest for the top job at the upcoming BCCI election . " I have not decided on it. Basically I am not eager ( to contest for president 's post ) , " Pawar said . Pawar is considered as one of the contenders to take over BCCI 's reins from the faction which is close to president-in-exile N Srinivasan . As per a recent Supreme Court verdict , Srinivasan can not contest the upcoming BCCI elections unless he disassociates himself from his Indian Premier League franchise Chennai Super Kings on the ground of conflict of interest . MCA sources had earlier said , Pawar , if he jumps into the fray , was confident of getting the requisite support from the East Zone as well as the rest of the Board if it comes to a contest with the ruling faction . This time it 's the turn of East zone to propose and second the candidature of BCCI president . Meanwhile , a routine MCA Managing Committee meeting that was scheduled for tomorrow has been cancelled ahead of the AGM .
