Teary-eyed at the World Cup The author has posted comments on this article Shiva Prasad , TNN | Mar 27 , 2015 , 01.45PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 Sport is such that the heartbreak of a loss or the exhilaration of a win can not make you hide your emotions. When the loss and disappointment come at a crucial juncture in the games , the emotions are harder to rein in. While there have been many occasions when the players have been caught angry , happy and annoyed , there have been only few instances when they have let the tears flow unhindered. Here 's taking a look at some tearjerking moments in World Cup cricket.. . INZY 'S FINAL WALK Inzamam cried like an over-sized baby as he got out in his final match in the 2007 World Cup.The talented Pakistani cricketer cried as he left the field with a guard of honour having lost his wicket against Zimbabwe during the 2007 World Cup.

Kambli went off the field crying inconsolably , after match referee Clive Lloyd stopped the game and awarded the match to Sri Lanka . YET ANOTHER CHOKE The South Africans were pushed to tears even in World Cup 2011 , when they lost a quarter-final match against the same opposition. The whole team was inconsolable and started crying then , as they so desperately wanted the victory . FIERY-TONGUED TO WELLED-UP EYES Pakistani bowler Wahab Riaz bowled the spell of his life , to put up a brave fight against the Australians after his team scored a mere 213 runs in the quarter final match at the ICC World Cup 2015.The tears after the game were proof of the effort he had put in and his sportsmanship , too , came to fore when he hugged and congratulated Shane Watson after the match , despite having a fiery verbal duel with him when he was bowling .
