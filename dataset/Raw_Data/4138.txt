Sammy will continue to be T20 captain meaning West Indies have separate skippers for all three formats . " Denesh Ramdin , the Wicket-keeper/Batsman , has been named new Test Match Captain of the West Indies Team. Congrats to him on the appointment , " the West Indies Cricket Board wrote on its Twitter handle . " The WICB also thanks Darren Sammy for his time at the helm as Test Match Captain from November 2010. He will remain as T20 Captain , " the board added . Ramdin has led the national side in three T20s and an ODI. His has got the experience of captaining Trinidad & Tobago in 37 matches across all formats , taking T&T to the semifinal of the Regional Four Day Competition this season . Sammy , who was appointed captain in 2010 , was relieved of his one-day duties in 2013 and was replaced by all-rounder Dwayne Bravo . Sammy 's tenure as Test captain began in November 2010 when West Indies drew a three-match series against the hosts Sri Lanka. He led West Indies to series victories twice over Bangladesh , Zimbabwe and New Zealand . But disastrous results on the Test tours of India and New Zealand last year raised doubts over his leadership abilities and his individual failure as an all-rounder has also not helped his case .
