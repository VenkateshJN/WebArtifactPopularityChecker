Tamil Nadu post historic win over Mumbai The author has posted comments on this article Prasad RS , TNN | Jan 23 , 2015 , 09.55PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 CHENNAI : Tamil Nadu rewrote a 64-year-old record after their innings and 44-run win over Mumbai in the Group 'A ' Ranji Trophy clash at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday. The last time Mumbai had lost by an innings was against Gujarat ( innings and 166 runs ) way back in 1951 at Ahmedabad . Right from Day 1 , this has been a 'mismatch'. While Tamil Nadu utilized the conditions well with the ball in both the innings and batted brilliantly in the only opportunity they got , their opponents were found wanting in all departments. The disparity in the two sides showed in the one-sided contest which ended a day earlier . When the third day started , Mumbai needed to score 264 more runs from their overnight total of 12-1 to make Tamil Nadu bat again. Mumbai were kept in the hunt , thanks to contributions from skipper Suryakumar Yadav ( 65 , 9x4 ) , Shreyas Iyer ( 52 , 7x4 ) , Siddhesh Lad ( 42 , 6x4 ) and opener Aditya Tare ( 36 , 4x4 ) , but the rest failed to even score in double figures. Even as Suryakumar tried his best to delay the inevitable , his counterpart from Tamil Nadu — Abhinav Mukund — was ringing in some smart bowling changes . Mumbai 's most experienced batsman — Wasim Jaffer ( 3 ) was the first to depart , caught at forward short-leg by R Indrajith off Malolan ( 1-43 ) to leave them at 13-2 in the fifth over of the day. At 33-2 , Rahil Shah ( 2-48 ) dropped a straightforward chance at mid-wicket of Iyer , when he was on 15 , off Suresh Kumar 's ( 1-54 ) first over of the day. The Iyer-Tare pair then added 84 for the third wicket before Abhinav introduced part-timer M Vijay into the attack in the 47th over of the innings . Vijay got one to climb on Tare who only managed to give a catch at backward short-leg to R Sathish. Mumbai had been reduced to 97-3. Three runs later , Vijay had his next victim in the form of Iyer whose shot ricocheted off the forward-short-leg fielder , and R Sathish at backward short-leg did well to latch on to it . Mumbai had now sunk to 100-4. The Suryakumar-Siddhesh pair then stitched together a 75-run partnership for the 5th wicket. Abhinav once again made the masterstroke , tossing the ball to Sathish in 80th over of the innings. Sathish , who replaced Vijay from the pavilion end , struck with his fourth ball trapping Siddhesh in front , leaving Mumbai at 175-5 . Soon , Mumbai lost Sarfaraz Khan ( 0 ) and Shardul Thakur ( 3 ) , but skipper Suryakumar continued to fight on. Abhinav , whose proactive captaincy has been one of the standout features in Tamil Nadu 's win , brought Aushik Srinivas ( 3-27 ) from the far end. The plan paid off as Aushik managed an edge off Suryakumar 's willow with a delivery that turned , bounced and keeper Dinesh Karthik completed the act . Once Suryakumar departed , the hosts did n't take long to finish things off and walk away with their second successive innings win of the season. Tamil Nadu now have 23 points from seven games and are second in the table , while Mumbai have 11 from 6 outings .
