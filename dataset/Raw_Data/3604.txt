Factbox on India World Cup squad The author has posted comments on this article Reuters | Feb 6 , 2015 , 09.53AM IST Factbox on the India squad for the 2015 cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand . Captain : Mahendra Singh Dhoni The 33-year-old stumper-batsman is India 's most successful captain , having led the team to the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup triumph in 2007 and the 50-over World Cup four years later. A hard-hitting batsman with a penchant to seal victory with a six , Dhoni 's phlegmatic-yet-unconventional captaincy will be key to India 's title defence . Coach : Duncan Fletcher The 66-year-old former Zimbabwe cricketer played six One Day Internationals for his country and was known more for designing Zimbabwe 's car registration system. In 1999 , he became the first foreigner to coach England and succeeded Gary Kirsten as India coach in 2011 . Squad : Mahendra Singh Dhoni ( captain ) , Virat Kohli ( vice-captain ) , Ajinkya Rahane , Shikhar Dhawan , Rohit Sharma , Stuart Binny , Suresh Raina , Ravindra Jadeja , Ambati Rayudu , Akshar Patel , Ravichandran Ashwin , Bhuvneshwar Kumar , Mohammed Shami , Umesh Yadav , Ishant Sharma . Key batsman : Virat Kohli - The 26-year-old right-hander from Delhi has emerged as one of the most improved batsmen in contemporary cricket. An elegant stroke-player with a wide range of shots , Kohli 's consistency and a 90-plus strike rate in One Day Internationals make him a dangerous batsman . A natural leader and an agile fielder , Kohli thrives under pressure and enhanced his batting reputation in the recent four-Test series against Australia even though India lost 2-0 . Key Bowler : Ravichandran Ashwin - The lanky 26-year-old off-spinner from Chennai may not be the biggest turner of the ball but possesses enough variety , including a carrom ball which he flicks with his long fingers , and control to trouble most batsmen in 50-over cricket . An extremely smart bowler who can stifle a batsman with his accuracy , Ashwin is also a handy lower order batsman and a safe catcher .
