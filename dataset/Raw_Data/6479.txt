4 1 14.2 to Smith , 128.8 kph , Smith has thrown it away. Another wicket falls against the run of play today. Full and wide outside off from Oram , it was there for the flaying , but Smith had to keep it down. He did not get the front foot across , and hence carved it in the air. How , the substitute , was waiting at a cross between gully and backward point. Nicely taken. Smith threw the kitchen sink at it , but forgot to first unscrew the thing from the wall. Can the Kiwis get back into the game now ? 69/2 32.5 to Botha , 125.6 kph , and another one gone , short of length ball that moved away a touch , Botha plays down the wrong line , he was looking to defend down the middle stump , but the ball was heading for off , and South Africa are six down 128/6 34.2 to Peterson , 121.5 kph , Oram ca n't hide his glee , he 's running around in glee , tip-toeing with a naughty smile on his face. Brendon McCullum is happy as well. Tragedy for Robin Peterson. Back of a length ball angling across him , it may have kept lower than he thought as he went for the slash and got an under edge. Clear noise , and through to Baz. Robin 's gone. South Africa 's World Cup is coming to an end. 132/7 42.5 to du Plessis , 129.7 kph , Faf 's gone , and with that , I reckon the last ember of South African hope. Tragedy for the Proteas. Ca n't blame him for going for another big hit , he had to do this all by himself. It was a full delivery wide outside off and Faf lined it up by moving towards leg stump. He made really solid contact with a cracking sliced cover drive , but Southee was at cover point. It went dead straight to him. Oram has 4. What a game he is having ! He so badly wanted to play this World Cup after all those injuries. It 's a happy Friday night out for the big man. 172/9
