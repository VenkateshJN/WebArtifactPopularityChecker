Â© AFP London : England fast bowler Stuart Broad insisted Tuesday he had not meant to insult low-paid workers following an angry response to a tweet about Britain 's minimum wage . " I 've heard if you earn minimum wage in England you 're in the top 10 percent earners in the world. # stay # humble , " the 28-year-old posted in a now deleted tweet . Given Broad , a senior England player for several years , earns considerably more than the minimum wage , there were many who took issue with his comments . However , Broad subsequently insisted the hashtag was meant as a reminder to himself rather than a general instruction to the public . " Clarifying my earlier tweet , I merely wanted to emphasise my amazement at just how big the world is , " he said . " No offence meant and sorry if any taken. The hashtag was aimed at myself.
