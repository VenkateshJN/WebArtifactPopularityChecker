OLDEST Bobby_Talyarkhan on April 12 , 2015 , 0 : 22 GMT Richie and Jim Laker were a great commentating partnership during the English summers of the seventies. Perhaps because they were playing contemporaries and both great spinners - but they seemed to savour the arts cricket had to offer and pass on their appreciation to those of us lucky enough to listen to them. Richie would communicate his enjoyment of a a special piece of action by momentarily dropping his clipped understated style and indulging himself in more florid language - I remember him describing one of Kapil Dev 's 4 sixes to save the follow on at Lords in 1991 as a " doodlebug " . I also remember him once walking off at the close of play at the Oval in 1987 and being acclaimed as a conquering hero by the massed hordes most of us the worse for wear after a day at the cricket. He had also mastered and consciously practiced the art of saying as little as possible and letting the action unfolding before the eyes of the television viewer do the talking - a trait sadly missing today . on April 10 , 2015 , 13 : 41 GMT I had the honor of looking after his PC for a few years while he was in England each Summer. He was a lovely man , extraordinarily tolerant of computer foibles for one of his generation. He once spilled wine on his laptop , and we had the moment described to us by his secretary , his wife , and then the man himself. Each of them used precisely the same wording , even unto the hand gesture to indicate the actual spilling. Such was his professionalism , that even a wine/computer related experience was related with so precisely the mot juste that everyone aped it. He was also kind enough to send a bottle of champagne to our wedding - utterly unneeded , and not something any other client thought to do - a true gentleman. Thoughts with Daphne . _-Will-_ on April 10 , 2015 , 10 : 36 GMT RIP Richie Benaud. An exemplary captain and gentleman , whose many outstanding achievements across his various professions will likely remain unmatched indefinitely. People like Mr. Benaud do not come along very often. The class with which they carry themselves , and the levels of excellence they reach while merely going about their usual business , are to my mind asymptotic. A bar set so high that folks like me might reasonably expect to never reach it , despite best efforts. In whatever capacity that he affected us , we were surely lucky and better for it . richard-munir on April 10 , 2015 , 2 : 32 GMT It 's so strange and sad to write about someone like Richie Benaud 's , whom I grow listening cricket commentary and learning English to understand it. I 'm from Pakistan and I used to get up early morning ( in Pakistan time ) to sit next to my Grandpa , and as the commentary was in English I will keep asking my Grandpa what happened , he 'll say wait let the other commentator come on and I 'll tell you , and that was Mr. Richie Benaud 's , I live overseas now and have chanced to meet him , and shared this dream of meeting that special commentator , whom my Grandpa could understand. I have no words to describe the sadness and emptiness because of his passing that he was part of my cricket life which is so rich , I could open YouTube or put on an old DVD to listen his voice , which now I 'll do to pay my tribute and respect to him. World Cricket has lost today its Reverend commentator , who was best cricketer of his generation. May God Bless your soul Sir , and always stay in Peace and Heavens , Amen . MarinManiac on April 10 , 2015 , 2 : 10 GMT Rest in peace , Richie Benaud. I grew up with you , first in England , gracing our BBC screens , and then in later years on Channel Nine. You were the best in the business. Wish I 'd been able to see you play and lead as well , but at least there is some old footage of that too. Two for Two Hundred and Twenty-Two -- never a word wasted. You will be sorely missed , and will live on as an example of how to do it. Thanks for the memories . Biggus on April 10 , 2015 , 2 : 07 GMT It 's the end of an era for me , the passing of one of the very greatest ornaments to the game. He 's been there the whole way for me , from my very earliest glimmerings of interest in the game as a young boy he was there , overseeing my education in the game with his unmatched fairness , insight , wisdom and restraint. Only as I aged did I discover more about this wise old owl , about his penchant for smacking the ball all over the park , his mercurial captaincy , and of course his wonderful command of leg spin. His passing will be sorely felt all over the world , not just down here , for such was the calibre of the man. The Great King is dead . pa99 on April 13 , 2015 , 6 : 06 GMT as a young student in England fresh from India it was a pleasure to hear Richie Benaud & Jim Laker on TV and John Arlott on radio.

Benaud was one of the most astute tacticians the game has seen . on April 11 , 2015 , 13 : 02 GMT Very sad to hear the news of death of great cricketer & incomparable commemtator Kirk-at-Lords on April 11 , 2015 , 5 : 48 GMT ...

But as David Lloyd said on Sky Sports , " There 'll never be another Ritchie ; it 's that simple " . That he passed in the very shadow of the Indian Premier League 's annual domination of the sport in April/May suggests just how much the cricket has lost spiritually , and how much we all need to reflect collectively on the distance that now separates us from the calm centre that Ritchie inhabited and helped make space for many of us to inhabit it with him , if only for a short time .

Kirk-at-Lords on April 11 , 2015 , 5 : 46 GMT In case no one else from the USA sends condolences , here are mine. Like most everyone I only knew Mr Benaud as a broadcaster mostly with Channel 9 Australia. When I was new to cricket in 2002/03 , viewing matches on SABC in South Africa and then on the freshly minted internet broadcasts of tours streamed to the USA , it was the Australian commentators that I learned the most from about the game , both in terms of technical details and history/culture. The dean of that lot was most certainly the one they all simply called " Ritchie " . I had only the barest idea of Mr Benaud 's contributions as a cricketer and national captain forty years and more prior. I do n't know when it was I realised he was an accomplished leg-spin bowler. Yet through the veils of my own ignorance as a cricket tragic in the making , I clearly perceived the man 's cricket brain , his nouse for human nature in general and sportsmanship in particular , and his oh so dry sense of humour. .. . srinivasan1317 on April 11 , 2015 , 5 : 30 GMT One of my best commentator during 1970 's and 80 's on Radio and then on television. I can still remember some of his favourite commentary. I am sad to see him go now. Let god keep his soul rest in peace . dilscoop_uk on April 10 , 2015 , 20 : 54 GMT R.I.P Richie.. You 'll always be remembered.From all Cricket lovers in Pakistan . fanofcricket123 on April 10 , 2015 , 19 : 58 GMT The headline misled me and how I wish it was what I originally thought. I was under the impression that he was never going to commentate. It soon sunk in that he was no longer going to talk or breathe cricket . on April 10 , 2015 , 19 : 53 GMT ,l remember listening commentary of Test match in which Benaud bowled out Peter May 's England side dramatically. A great person ,unbiased , gentleman to the core. All commentators should learn from his style . His words , voice blended with game without ever distracting the on going game. For me his death is a personal loss. He will always be remembered . Nitesh_DK on April 10 , 2015 , 19 : 31 GMT This piece of sad news has robbed us from yet another invaluable gem after Tony Greig 's death. Both of them use to present the game in an precise yet very charismatic manner unlike today where all the stats & graphics have become much of an gimmick really. The blissful memories which both Richie & Tony have left with us would be cherished for a longer time to come. RIP Legends . Big_Poppa_94 on April 10 , 2015 , 18 : 42 GMT I 'm too young to know of Richie Benaud , personally or just through his commentary. I think he commentated during the 99 World Cup but that WC is too hazy in my memory ( was only 7 at that time ) . All I can say is , whoever has spoken about him has done so in high regard. My thoughts go out to his family , friends and those who had a connection to him as a fan of his commentary. May you light up the heavens with your colourful personality . johnthekiwi on April 10 , 2015 , 17 : 02 GMT Awful but obviously inevitable news. At the passing of truly great people you always tend to get reflective about events you can remember based around them. Mine was his commentaries during the 1985 NZ vs. Aus series when RJH was practically un-hittable and the " fine shot that " he would pepper in over decades of commentary. A great life lived by a great man. Every cricket fan that ever had the pleasure of hearing his voice will never forget him. 84 is a bloody good knock too , lets not forget that . RohanMarkJay on April 10 , 2015 , 16 : 31 GMT Ritchie Benaud. One of Cricket 's greatest presenters , I will always remember him as some one who brought a lot of dad pan humour. His sharp wit and high intelligence , meant in years gone by , I would listen to what sayings not just on cricket but life he would offer us. He was one of the best sports presenters I ever saw , presenting any sport. He kept cricket going against the grain in England and Australia for 40 years. Probably kept comedians endless material to keep their careers going. I will miss him. The voice of cricket on TV in both England and Australia in the 1960s , 1970s,1980s , 1990s and early 2000s. He had hell of a broadcasting career. The one and only Ritchie Benaud. Great character , one and only Rithcie Benaud. Rest in Peace. Will miss your entertaining sports commentary . on April 10 , 2015 , 16 : 18 GMT A great player who told it like it is. In his memoirs he speaks glowingly about those he played against , giving credit where it is due. For instance , when writing about the ( late ) great Fazal Mahmood of Pakistan , he wrote that Fazal 's legcutters were just unplayable on the matting wickets that were used in those days. He was by far the best bowler in the world , on those kind of wickets. What a man ! Ritchie Benaud- always remembered and never forgotten . Sarvgya Panta on April 10 , 2015 , 16 : 14 GMT Rest In Peace Richie Banaud bigscore215 on April 10 , 2015 , 15 : 25 GMT Richie Benuad goes down in history as one of the nicest human being I have seen in my life. back in 1980 's , he used to voice his opinion on what he think as correct. he never favor anything and its just he is very calm man and a very great man. thats how the life is. Everyone has to go one day but Richie benuad will be remembered for generations to come . on April 10 , 2015 , 15 : 23 GMT Richie - most of us were not even born when you retired from the game - we know you only by your nonchalant voice over Radio Australia or Channel 9 - yet you were as popular as any other sporting star. You were one of the few Aussies who was unbiased , dignified , respectful of all and sundry. The cricketing world has definitely lost an Aussie gentleman - all of us will miss you mate ! RIP on April 10 , 2015 , 15 : 19 GMT A legend among legends. The greatest ever. Will miss his comments. Had the privilege to hear radio commentaries during his playing days , including the tied test May God Rest his Soul in Eternal Peace on April 10 , 2015 , 15 : 06 GMT As a young boy in the early 60s in England ,I grew to love his commentary. His knowledge of cricket was fantastic , I loved his neutral comments and the ability to praise each player regardless of nationality. A true gentleman and a voice that I loved to listen to. RIP Richie you are loved not just in Australia but in England too . FiGhtCluB_99 on April 10 , 2015 , 14 : 40 GMT RIP , Richie. His commentary used to add life to even the most boring games. Never watched him play , but I 've heard he 's one of the greatest ever. Sad day this . on April 10 , 2015 , 14 : 23 GMT The greatest commentator of all time in all sports. I grew up listening to his commentary. He was always so spot on that his commentary seemed effortless. It was as if his heart flowed along with the match and his cricket brain would tell us the story. A true pioneer. The commentary team of Benaud , Lawry , Greig , Chappell is the best ever. It is not just my opinion but cricket was sometimes watched just to listen to Richie than the cricket that was played. I am surprised he was not knighted for his services. Rest in peace Sir Richie ! ! bohurupi on April 10 , 2015 , 14 : 03 GMT Paying my highest tribute to Richie Benaud. What a great commentator he was ! His loss in the cricket world is irreparable. We 'll be missing him all time . brusselslion on April 10 , 2015 , 13 : 59 GMT Growing up in the 70s , Arlott on the radio , and Benaud on the telly ( plus McGilvray and Cozier ) . A golden age for cricket commentators. However , as the article suggests Benaud was more than just a great commentator. Should have been knighted for his services to cricket . SaratheGreat on April 10 , 2015 , 13 : 20 GMT RIP Richie Benaud. It is really a sad day for all the cricket lovers. I was born in Nineties. For me to follow the Australian Cricket is only made by this gentleman 's voice. Being from India we have the match telecast starting around 3 : 30 to 4 : 00 AM . Apart from the eagerness to Watch the legends of David Boon , Mark , Steve , McGrath , Warne and many more we watch it for Richie 's voice. He is commendable and has a unique voice. There are so many person like me who will agree to it. We were so lucky . Edward Wayne John on April 10 , 2015 , 13 : 07 GMT Grew up listen to that voice on radio commentary in the caribbean ...along with tony cozier were the voices of great AUS/ WI battles ! ! Rest in peace great man ! on April 10 , 2015 , 12 : 53 GMT One more reason to put the TV on mute when the Ashes or any Aus v/s.... test is on.We 've gone through so much over the last few years losing all the nice ones.Greig,Phil Hughes and Richie Benaud . shortsillypoint on April 10 , 2015 , 12 : 46 GMT Thanks Ritchie , world class player and the grown up on the commentary team. Irreplaceable. He was marvellous , just marvellous . on April 10 , 2015 , 12 : 46 GMT Although he will mostly be remembered for his commentary , he was also a top quality leg spinner. Most of his five wicket hauls were against India , despite the fact that Indians are traditionally better players of spin bowling . on April 10 , 2015 , 12 : 40 GMT What a Great Cricketer & Awe-inspiring Personality - that 's what Richie Benaud was ! ! I had the privilege of watching the 1996 Calcutta Test Match between Australia & India . Richie Benaud along with Ray Lindwall , Neil Harvey , Wally Grout , Alan Davidson & others graced the haloed Eden Garden turf . It was an immense pleasure to see their professional approach & high degree of sportsmanship . Even after so many years & my own modest domestic cricketing career fading into twilight , the memories of that match still remains clearly etched in my mind - dominated by Richie Benaud as an undisputed leader . May his soul rest in eternal peace ! ! CricketChat on April 10 , 2015 , 12 : 27 GMT RIP. One of the greatest commentators across generations who stayed close to all fans , old and new , by embracing the changes in the game. Someone who appreciated good cricket irrespective of team affiliations and never took sides even if Aussies were playing the match. A true legend anyway one sees him . on April 10 , 2015 , 12 : 26 GMT Richie Benaud , the voice of my childhood when I was learning to love the game. When he said good morning to the viewers you almost found yourself wishing him good morning as well. He knew what to say and when to say it. He let the pictures tell the story. Always insightful , always authoritative , always understated , never took it too seriously. Not just greatly respected in the cricketing world , he was much loved for who he was and how he did it , both as a cricketer and a journalist. A true one off , one of the greats . sam6e on April 10 , 2015 , 12 : 19 GMT Truly a very sad day... Even the game would have cried with his loss... As a subcontinent fan I did loved the wonderful commentary of best trio Richie , Tony n lawry... The best combination ever to listen n sad it will never be back.. Miss you sir neil99 on April 10 , 2015 , 12 : 08 GMT Richie " what a marvellous delivery that was " . Player , commentator , legend. The face of BBCs TV coverage for years and Thursdays at 10.50am werent the same without his " Good morning everybody " . If it was n't for Richie I 'd never gave gotten into the sport. The current crop of Australian players and managemnt would earn and awful lot of respect if they were capable of playing the game in the same manner as Ritchie Benaud. RIP . cruisecontrol on April 10 , 2015 , 12 : 08 GMT With his passing , we are now staring at and exposed to the cacophony of the current breed of shills and supposed commentators. I can not bear to listen to any of the current crop ( except a really small handful of them such as Mark Nichols ) . I hope the current breed of commentators -- particularly those from my country-- will take a strategic ( sic ! ) time-out from the supposed professional league to practice his dictum : " If you can add to what 's on the screen then do it , otherwise do n't. " In context , here 's an excerpt from Yeats ' " The Second Coming " : " Turning and turning in the widening gyre The falcon can not hear the falconer ; Things fall apart ; the centre can not hold ; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world , The blood-dimmed tide is loosed , and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned ; The best lack all conviction , while the worst Are full of passionate intensity. " cruisecontrol on April 10 , 2015 , 12 : 08 GMT Sorry to see a great cricketer , commentator , and human pass. I started listening to Richie from the time I was a kid in a remote corner of India. For me , he not only interpreted cricket , sport , and human endeavor but was also a singular signpost to what competition , fair play , and decency on and off the field must be ( even beyond the underarm event ) . He 's not only an Australian great or a cricket great but a truly great world citizen and sportsperson. We will miss him terribly - all around the world including in my small town India . on April 10 , 2015 , 11 : 57 GMT RIP Richie Benaud. I never got to see you play , but your face and voice was all too familiar on TV. Your comments and analysis of the game were superb always. We will miss you . zoot364 on April 10 , 2015 , 11 : 56 GMT Thank you Richie. The steely , independent voice the game needs but so rarely has . woody3 on April 10 , 2015 , 11 : 31 GMT The word legend is used too often , however Richie Benaud can not be described any other way . on April 10 , 2015 , 11 : 21 GMT This is sad. Very sad only . vippra on April 10 , 2015 , 10 : 55 GMT All of us will miss Richie , who was a role model and a true Cricketer who played the game in its True spirit . It is indeed sad that the current lot of cricketers ( with some exceptions of course ) have not seen fit to emulate him ! His demise is a great lost to World Cricket . MasterBlaster100 on April 10 , 2015 , 10 : 53 GMT I think it was Richie , more than Dilley or Lillee or Beefy who made me first take an interest in this marvellous game. I am sure millions more would say the same. The " confectionary stall " is my first memory of cricket . markatnotts on April 10 , 2015 , 10 : 45 GMT A sad day for cricket , I am way too young to have seen him as a player but he was spoken of by those I know who were/are old enough as an outstanding Captain. Unfortunately the last time he was on TV in the UK was during the Great Ashes of 2005 in England as that was the last year on Channel 4 before cricket went to Sky. I remember at the time how he mentioned an old song he liked - " Time to say goodbye " during the last over of his commentary in England. I also respected his views on " free to air " and refusing to move over to the Sky team . on April 10 , 2015 , 10 : 22 GMT And so passes the end of an era. Just 3 years ago we lost Tony Greig. And now we have lost the voice of cricket. Richie Benaud. In the days and weeks to come , the cricketing world will turn it 's eyes back to the past. Back to the time when a young all-rounder debuted for Australia in 1952 , Test cricket at possibly it 's lowest ever point. He debuted at just 21 years old , and for a while never really stood out. That is , until the 1957/58 tour of South Africa. In that tour , he claimed 30 wickets , his googly confusing even the best of the South African players at the time. From that point on , Benaud was a staple in the Australian team. He went on to captain Australia and become the first man to score 2000 runs and take 200 wickets. His Australian team never lost a series and only lost a few games. One can not forget Benaud 's commentator career. His voice was the voice of cricket for decades and despite his passing , his will continue to be one of the worlds most recognisable voices . on April 10 , 2015 , 9 : 59 GMT A man I admired in my playing days , we had some thing in common but not to the same standard or calibre. I too was a leg spinner ! Rest in peace Richie Bhanu on April 10 , 2015 , 9 : 59 GMT It was sheer pleasure watching cricket when the great man was on air.No wonder he has taken cricket commentary to a different plane altogether.When India toured Australia in the early eighties one always waited for the days highlights hosted by Richie Benaud ( those days there was no live relay of the matches ) .Clearly remember him commenting with a smile when Dennis Lillie surpassed his tally of 248 wickets.Cricket commentary is not about harping about the proceedings in the middle its about infusing life into the game.Maybe the guys doing the commentary nowadays can imbibe something from this man. Thanks for some wonderful memories mate ! ! ! ! ! ! on April 10 , 2015 , 9 : 56 GMT It is painstakingly difficult to digest the sad fact that the great voice of cricket shall sound no more ! My sincerest condolences I wish to express to his family and all those who grieve and mourn his passing at this time. He was a champion on the field of play--not losing a single test series ; in the commentary booth , he was the voice of all voices ; he had absolutely no equal. His legend will forever live in the annals of cricketing history as well as our memories. Sadly we will miss the perfection , clarity , eloquence and unquestionable conviction with which he masterfully executed his assignments ! Richie , as you prepare to enter the great unknown , your exemplary life has given us great confidence that you 'll face each challenge with the will to win ! R.I.P . 11_Warrior on April 10 , 2015 , 9 : 44 GMT Rest in Peace Richie Benaud md111 on April 10 , 2015 , 9 : 38 GMT Great cricketers have passed on but nothing is quite the same as this. Mainly for the reason that , especially in Australia and England , he was the person that would take you through the summer. He was the guide that helped you understand what you were watching and let you know any of the intricacies of what was going on. There are n't may people from the ( cricketing ) world who had the admiration of the English and Australians , Richie Benaud was one of those . FurqanKhan on April 10 , 2015 , 9 : 37 GMT One of the biggest loss for the world cricket. As a young kid I was always mesmarised by a voice which used to be so staggering for any one let alone a cricket lover. He is one of the brightest chapter of cricket which will never be forgotten. He took cricket to a whole new level as a brand and in the end did great service for both players and spectators. We are thankful to him for his great services . Shahid06 on April 10 , 2015 , 9 : 34 GMT Always loved his commentary style and he was no doubt one of the best in that domain. We will miss him no doubt about that. RIP Mr. Benaud . on April 10 , 2015 , 9 : 28 GMT Thank you Richie ! The most influential in Aus cricket in my lifetime ( in a good way ) Richie Benaud , then Bradman , then S Waugh. What a wonderful life Mr RB ! proudbrummie on April 10 , 2015 , 9 : 28 GMT I feel like I have lost a close personal friend , he truly was the voice of summer , his deep love of cricket & indeed cricket commentary was a major plank in leading me into a life long love affair with the noblest of games ! Never saw him play , my first interest in Cricket started in summer of 64 , my first at Grammar School and it was an Ashes summer. Hopefully this years ashes will start with a minutes silence for the peerless and inimitable master of the microphone , Richie enters the elysian fields and becomes first choice skipper for the eternal young Australian side ! RIP smudgeon on April 10 , 2015 , 9 : 13 GMT When I was growing up watching cricket , my dad always turned the volume down on the telly and put ABC radio on instead. It 's a habit I inherited as I got older ( and got my own telly ) , but I always swapped back when I knew Richie was back in the box. Richie was the voice of cricket. Adieu , Richie . on April 10 , 2015 , 9 : 06 GMT Great commentator and a true gentleman. RIP Richie Benaud . on April 10 , 2015 , 9 : 06 GMT RIP Mr. Benaud. You are a true legend and a gentleman. Cricket will certainly gmsjgmsj on April 10 , 2015 , 9 : 04 GMT A great commentary of Richie during the WC final 1992... Pakistan were winning the match with the fall of the England 's 9th wicket and Richie says in his inimitable style.... " The Pakistan players , the spectators in the stadium and i suspect , millions back home , are dancing in absolute joy ! " . Just recall the vocal content , the intonations and the pauses in that sentence. Even now after two decades , i get goosebumps when i remember that one moment in Richie 's commentary . Farewell , dear Richie , like you there shall never be another. RIP . on April 10 , 2015 , 9 : 01 GMT RICHIE BENAUD - a Cricketer par excellence ! ! I had the privilege of watching the 1996 Calcutta Test Match between Australia & India . Richie Benaud along with Ray Lindwall , Alan Davidson , Wally Grout & others thrilled the Indian crowds . Even though each one of them was a cricketing legend on his own merit , Richie Benaud over-shadowed all of them . They thrilled the Indian crowds with their superb professional approach & display of great sportsman spirit . Even after all these years , the memories of that game remain clearly etched in my mind . May his soul rest in peace . Gillyisgreat on April 10 , 2015 , 8 : 59 GMT Richie the voice of Cricket , not just the Australian one , but the global one. He embraced the future and never embellished the past . He knew when to talk and when not to. A great man . on April 10 , 2015 , 8 : 49 GMT what a great loss ! we will miss him and cricket analysis and commentary will never be the same again without Richie Benaud , may he RIP . Mervo on April 10 , 2015 , 8 : 34 GMT Well said RICHARD-MUNIR. Thanks for sharing that. Benaud was true gentleman , yet a brave , aggressive player and captain on the field. He played the game with great passion and adventure. I well recall how delighted he was with Shane Warne 's career. Leg spin had almost died until Warne brought it to centre stage again. Richie will be greatly missed across Australia by all true cricket lovers . on April 10 , 2015 , 8 : 33 GMT Richie was a true legend of game of Cricket. Unfortunately , not many people are there in present day , even to come closer . We are all so sad & his demise is a great lost to world cricket. May he rest in peace. . jayjtee on April 10 , 2015 , 8 : 31 GMT My favorite piece of Richie commentary Brilliant , just brilliant.... is n't that the most brilliant thing you 've ever seen !

Simply irreplaceable . gogoldengreens on April 10 , 2015 , 8 : 22 GMT Marvellous Gentleman - who would be the most influential ever on the game when his playing days are added to his bringing the game from crackling transistor radios days to High Definition TV & internet technology. Certainly always did what he said about only adding to the picture what the viewer can not see rather than telling them what they are viewing like his fellow commentators.. . Engr.TahirShah on April 10 , 2015 , 8 : 12 GMT For me Richie passed away the moment he left the commentators box for the last few years. Cricket was alive , when he was alive and speaking behind the microphone. Its actually the death of cricket more than the death of a person . ameer.mohammad on April 10 , 2015 , 7 : 50 GMT Could n't watch him play but i remember playing Cricket '97 on PC in which he used to commentate.

From a kiwi 's perspective , he was the only Channel Nine commentator who commentated with both eyes open , a rare attribute for any countries cricket broadcaster. Nothing but respect Mr Benaud , my thoughts go to your family , friends and colleagues tonight . on April 10 , 2015 , 7 : 27 GMT Another sad of cricket history....richie was the voice of cricket...pioneer of modern commentary....u will be missed sir...RIP JG2704 on April 10 , 2015 , 7 : 25 GMT RIP gentle man. Too young to know him as a fine cricketer but grew up with him commentating on the BBC and was superb in managing to show his vast knowledge of the game but without coming across as a know all. Sad loss on April 10 , 2015 , 7 : 23 GMT I was never aware of him. Although after reading this I will say something really gud has gone.

SupportTestCricket on April 10 , 2015 , 7 : 12 GMT It 's a huge huge loss for cricket lovers. He was one of a kind. I always remember his match analysis starting with his inimitable " We pick up the action , Lillee bowling to Boycott in the first over " to the way he used to look down from the camera as soon as he finished. RIP Richie . on April 10 , 2015 , 6 : 57 GMT You taught this Dutchman how to love cricket , Mr Benaud. Rest in peace . gmsjgmsj on April 10 , 2015 , 6 : 42 GMT Another one of his goldies.... when Inzamam was bowled between his legs.. " you wont believe this. He 's done him between his legs ! " . Another one , i think during the 79 WC. Viv had hit one monstrous six over deep mid wicket.. " its in the air.. " . After a pause of about 10-20 secs , Benaud continues " ...its still in the air " . Classic. only as Benaud can do.The Jack Fingleton of TV commentary . Lenniesahayi on April 10 , 2015 , 6 : 41 GMT I got to start watching cricket a bit late but I could always appreciate the high command of both the attention of viewers and cricket terminology the good old Richie had.

Richie and Bill Lawry were a great team I hope contemporary commentators learn from Richie and Bill . Sad to hear that Richie suffered much during his final years . Nutcutlet on April 10 , 2015 , 6 : 10 GMT One of the great players , one of the greatest captains and a peerless commentator - the significance of the passing of Richie Benaud can not be overstated. I first came to cricket consciousness in 1958-59. I knew that Australia had been 'Lakered ' in '56. England had dominated world cricket for six years and the boast was England had never sent such a strong side to Aus in the autumn of '58. But Australia soon sank England 's Titanic team , because Benaud led his men inspirationally , out-thinking PBH May at every turn. England ended that tour in disarray... Benaud and Frank Worrell. These two remain the greatest of all captains , and gentlemen out of the top drawer . on April 10 , 2015 , 6 : 09 GMT The voice of cricket is lost.We all will miss you Richie.A running dictionary of world cricket.A great loss of world cricket.RIP Benaud on April 10 , 2015 , 6 : 08 GMT Sad moment for cricket. My heart goes out to his family and friends. He was part of a great trio with Greig and Lawry. Remember waking up in the early hours of the morning in Pakistan to watch the Australian summer of cricket and one of the main attractions was the commentary of these three gentlemen . nothirdman on April 10 , 2015 , 6 : 06 GMT My two favourite Richie memories : 1. Some time in the '80s ; he and Tony were promoting Slip Slop Slap and the dangers of skin cancer , when Tony harked back to happy days in India ... " when I think of how we used to abuse ourselves out there ... " Long pause. Never was Richie 's capacity for silence more golden. When he judged that the TV audience had recovered , he quietly asked " Are you sure you want to go on with that ? " 2. Darwin , 2003 or 2004. Someone in the crowd was dressed as Ali G , with the yellow gear and the black goatee. Richie let the close-up image settle and remarked " The .. er .. Jason Gillespie fan club ... " The master . on April 10 , 2015 , 6 : 05 GMT By far the best person in sports on TV. He will be remembered for a long time ! ! !

RIP ! ! ! landl47 on April 10 , 2015 , 5 : 52 GMT The first test match my Dad took me to see was England v. Australia at the Oval in 1961. Richie Benaud was captain of the Australian side , already having retained the Ashes. Since then he 's been a constant presence in my cricketing life ; I 've read his books and listened to his commentaries. I think he was the wisest and most knowledgeable cricketing person I 've ever seen. He also had a wonderful sense of humour , though you had to pay attention to catch it since he never mistook volume for quality . I 'm sure he would want his legacy to be that he helped make cricket a better game for others. Richie , this Pom can vouch for the fact that you did . Damien. on April 10 , 2015 , 5 : 51 GMT Nine network miss you badly. Your voice is with forever , Richie ! ! True gentleman and the voice of cricket.

I always wanted to hear him commentate live. Just heard your legendary commentary in old videos only , my dream stays a dream. God bless you ! : ( Juddy58 on April 10 , 2015 , 5 : 20 GMT It 's so strange to refer to Richie Benaud in the past tense. As long as we can remember he was the best commentator on TV with no one a patch on him. RIP , Richie . KiwiRocker- on April 10 , 2015 , 5 : 14 GMT As a small child growing up in Pakistan ( before making NZ my adopted homeland ) , I recall numerous tri series highlights that used to be shown on Pakistan 's state TV on those days. It was late 80 's and live coverage had not yet kicked in from places like Australia and New Zealand. My passion and love for the game made me wait for those highlight packages and I would always remember this very well spoken gentleman with grey hair that would start the highlight package. Of course that man was great Richie Benaud. I simply loved the way he would sum up situations during a match. He was so different from these so called commentators on payroll of different boards. Richie was unique. He said what he saw and he called how it was ! His balanced , fair and passionate style will always be missed. Sad loss and cricket commentary would never be same with Richie and Tony Greig ! crrkiran on April 10 , 2015 , 5 : 11 GMT a great player , a great commentator. also I enjoyed his commentary in video game pc Brian lara cricket 2000 on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 59 GMT EA Cricket will never be same . RIP Richie Benaud Sir . on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 55 GMT In 1984 during the Bensen & Hedges Series , first time i heard his commentary. What a commentator with full of cricket knowledge because he himself was a wonderful all rounder in the game. His command over English and accent was excellent. Indeed the best voice in Cricket Commentary , would be missed again and again. May God bless his soul and rest in peace and heaven . on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 54 GMT Huge loss indeed ! ! Ca n't imagine Channel 9 coverage without Richie on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 54 GMT A great Human Being , a great Captain and a Great All Arounder. One can never forget the tied Brsibane Test with the Windies , the Miracle win against England in the 1960 's OR the loss against India at Green Park Kanpur in 1959 ! He was blessed with a great team , M'cDonald , Stephen , Harvey , Oneill , Favell , Grout , Davidson , Kline ,Mackay ,Lindwal , Mckiff et all . Will be great missed by all Cricketers . alanl on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 47 GMT This is a very sad day ; the loss of a revered spokesman for our wonderful game. A gentleman , sage and wit. I lived for his close of play summaries , that laconic smile and those wickets to beat Engalnd in 62. I was there. I will sleep with heavy heart tonight. My sympathies extend to all my Aussie friends. Pommie in Canada on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 47 GMT He was neutral , analytical , clear , loved by everyone across the world. Now who 's there to replace him ? No one ! on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 44 GMT RIP Richie......no words left . jjawwwadd on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 41 GMT Though I never got a chance to see him playing the gentleman 's game but I will always cherish his voice which we used to hear in most of the cricket video games that we used to play ! Indeed the world has lost a legendary cricketer and a wonderful human being... ! cricsavvy on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 40 GMT We will miss " The voice of summer " forever.

Sir...cricket world is gon na miss you very much ! SamRoy on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 28 GMT Fantastic commentator ( the best ever bar none ) , fantastic player and captain. Cricket says good bye to one of its all-time legends. Probably the only one of the two Aussie captains along with Ian Chappell who believed in winning matches the right way. Cricket is poorer today . gt_doss on April 10 , 2015 , 4 : 16 GMT It 's sad to note that Richie is no more. What a gentleman he was !

When I first time read the title Rob Steen 's What makes a good commentator ? ( Apr 1 , 2015 ) the first name came to my mind is Richie Benaud 's. A very calm and composed,passionate and down to earth man with a vast knowledge. RIP great man . YogifromNY on April 10 , 2015 , 3 : 46 GMT Let me add my words of tribute and prayer for this wonderful cricketer 's soul. As a kid , I grew up waking up early mornings in India to tune in to Benaud 's marvelous commentary from Australia. I would tune into matches that he would be commentating on just to listen to him speak , along with Tony Greig. A sage and shrewd cricketer , he had an impact on generations of kids growing up not just in his native Australia or England , but also in India and across the cricketing world. I hope and pray you achieve an auspicious next destination , Richie , and are happy there too. May God bless you and your wife and other family members ! umairjqureshi on April 10 , 2015 , 3 : 37 GMT It sounded angelic and divine..here was someone who told you what was happening and not how...it said something like this " Wasim Akram has clean bowled alan lamb and perhaps so too England....next ball...you can take lewis off that list too....Akram is on a hat-trick " ...the words keep echoing in my ears from the 1992 final....Richie Benaud 's voice and words will never die.....my condolences to everyone in australia....specially to the Benaud family and friends....i really feel cricket broadcasting is orphaned today....first tony and now richie....deeply saddening and truly hearting.....RIP richie....see you on the other side.... .

Shongololo on April 10 , 2015 , 2 : 07 GMT A true gentleman and professional , whose commentary was invariably balanced and eloquent - and that 's a far , far cry from what 's now dished up in the Nine commentary box from the likes of Brayshaw , Warne , Slater and Healy .

You will be missed . on April 10 , 2015 , 1 : 40 GMT Still hoping that this news is false. Can not find the right English word for it...shell shocked or maybe just sadness. knew him for his commentary that was like a soothing balm amid the racy voices of the other channel 9 commentators. Maybe it is true that nothing lasts forever. It will take time to sink in. While the entire stadium and viewers on TV would roar along with Bill Lawry , he would still be the only one to quietly say " and that is a genuine googly " . jaggi.jagan on April 10 , 2015 , 1 : 39 GMT I have not see him play. But , his name always crosses my mind when I think of cricket and commentary. He has not only set a benchmark for other commentators to emulate , but also made that role truly his own !

Emancipator007 on April 10 , 2015 , 1 : 11 GMT Was never too enamored with his " simple " commentary style ( rated Chappelli the best analyst --technically as well as wrt insights on on-game tactics -- of the old-line Channel team ) but admired his patrician gentlemanliness which endeared him to millions ( " soft-spoken grand-dad Richie " ) . He was one of the first few Occidentals who discerned that Sunny Gavaskar was perhaps the greatest Test technician ever and the most fearless player of express pace bowling and when it was not fashionable to laud absolute world-class Asian greats. He also guided Sunny in the comm-box during his early stints in late '80s. He was dazzled by Akram 's pulsating talents as a tyro speedster in '80s. His commentary " persona " and fame ( much like Greigy ) overwhelmed his other great attributes- tactically astute captaincy , solid journalism skills and also mentor-role to many from the cricket ecosystem . on April 10 , 2015 , 1 : 10 GMT Rest in Peace.

RIP.. . on April 10 , 2015 , 1 : 01 GMT Richie Benaud is the gold standard by which all cricket commentators will be judged. He had an amazing voice and his insights were always precise and relevant. He was also extremely balanced and called it as he saw it - there was no home country bias. A big part of my childhood in India was getting up early to listen to him saying " grayt daay from the M.C.G " at the start. A big loss for Australia and the cricketing world at large. Rest in peace . Gabbagod on April 10 , 2015 , 0 : 57 GMT The voice of overseas tours , Alan McGilvray , and the voice of our home televised series Richie Benaud can now commentate together in heaven.

Your voice will live on forever Bobby_Talyarkhan on April 12 , 2015 , 0 : 22 GMT Richie and Jim Laker were a great commentating partnership during the English summers of the seventies. Perhaps because they were playing contemporaries and both great spinners - but they seemed to savour the arts cricket had to offer and pass on their appreciation to those of us lucky enough to listen to them. Richie would communicate his enjoyment of a a special piece of action by momentarily dropping his clipped understated style and indulging himself in more florid language - I remember him describing one of Kapil Dev 's 4 sixes to save the follow on at Lords in 1991 as a " doodlebug " . I also remember him once walking off at the close of play at the Oval in 1987 and being acclaimed as a conquering hero by the massed hordes most of us the worse for wear after a day at the cricket. He had also mastered and consciously practiced the art of saying as little as possible and letting the action unfolding before the eyes of the television viewer do the talking - a trait sadly missing today . on April 10 , 2015 , 13 : 41 GMT I had the honor of looking after his PC for a few years while he was in England each Summer. He was a lovely man , extraordinarily tolerant of computer foibles for one of his generation. He once spilled wine on his laptop , and we had the moment described to us by his secretary , his wife , and then the man himself. Each of them used precisely the same wording , even unto the hand gesture to indicate the actual spilling. Such was his professionalism , that even a wine/computer related experience was related with so precisely the mot juste that everyone aped it. He was also kind enough to send a bottle of champagne to our wedding - utterly unneeded , and not something any other client thought to do - a true gentleman. Thoughts with Daphne . _-Will-_ on April 10 , 2015 , 10 : 36 GMT RIP Richie Benaud. An exemplary captain and gentleman , whose many outstanding achievements across his various professions will likely remain unmatched indefinitely. People like Mr. Benaud do not come along very often. The class with which they carry themselves , and the levels of excellence they reach while merely going about their usual business , are to my mind asymptotic. A bar set so high that folks like me might reasonably expect to never reach it , despite best efforts. In whatever capacity that he affected us , we were surely lucky and better for it . richard-munir on April 10 , 2015 , 2 : 32 GMT It 's so strange and sad to write about someone like Richie Benaud 's , whom I grow listening cricket commentary and learning English to understand it. I 'm from Pakistan and I used to get up early morning ( in Pakistan time ) to sit next to my Grandpa , and as the commentary was in English I will keep asking my Grandpa what happened , he 'll say wait let the other commentator come on and I 'll tell you , and that was Mr. Richie Benaud 's , I live overseas now and have chanced to meet him , and shared this dream of meeting that special commentator , whom my Grandpa could understand. I have no words to describe the sadness and emptiness because of his passing that he was part of my cricket life which is so rich , I could open YouTube or put on an old DVD to listen his voice , which now I 'll do to pay my tribute and respect to him. World Cricket has lost today its Reverend commentator , who was best cricketer of his generation. May God Bless your soul Sir , and always stay in Peace and Heavens , Amen . MarinManiac on April 10 , 2015 , 2 : 10 GMT Rest in peace , Richie Benaud. I grew up with you , first in England , gracing our BBC screens , and then in later years on Channel Nine. You were the best in the business. Wish I 'd been able to see you play and lead as well , but at least there is some old footage of that too. Two for Two Hundred and Twenty-Two -- never a word wasted. You will be sorely missed , and will live on as an example of how to do it. Thanks for the memories . Biggus on April 10 , 2015 , 2 : 07 GMT It 's the end of an era for me , the passing of one of the very greatest ornaments to the game. He 's been there the whole way for me , from my very earliest glimmerings of interest in the game as a young boy he was there , overseeing my education in the game with his unmatched fairness , insight , wisdom and restraint. Only as I aged did I discover more about this wise old owl , about his penchant for smacking the ball all over the park , his mercurial captaincy , and of course his wonderful command of leg spin. His passing will be sorely felt all over the world , not just down here , for such was the calibre of the man. The Great King is dead . on April 10 , 2015 , 0 : 03 GMT Rest in Peace Sir.
