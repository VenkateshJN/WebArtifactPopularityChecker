Dalmiya consensus candidate from Srinivasan camp : Sources The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Feb 28 , 2015 , 09.37PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 CHENNAI : Veteran administrator Jagmohan Dalmiya has emerged as a consensus candidate in the N Srinivasan camp for the post of president in the BCCI elections to be held on Monday . Dalmiya , the president of Cricket Association of Bengal , controls two votes from East Zone and has emerged as a candidate for the top post since no other name was unanimously acceptable to all the units loyal to Srinivasan . The loyalists of Srinivasan , who met here today ahead of the much-awaited Annual General Meeting , have not decided the other panel members as yet . " As of now only Dalmiya 's name has emerged as a frontrunner for BCCI president 's post. No other name for other positions has been finalised yet , " a top BCCI official said . It is the turn of East Zone to nominate a president and it is still not clear whether the rival faction has been able to break any of the six East Zone units who have traditionally been loyal to Srinivasan . Maratha strongman Sharad Pawar , who has been projected as possible candidate for the president 's post , flew into the city this evening and was closeted in a meeting with his supporters. Former BCCI president Shashank Manohar has also arrived here for the AGM . It is still not clear whether Pawar will contest the elections. He is likely to plunge into the fray only if his group can cobble up enough numbers to win the polls . Dalmiya was made interim chief of the BCCI after Srinivasan stepped aside from the post in the wake of the IPL spot-fixing and betting scandal .
