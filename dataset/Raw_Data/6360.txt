Devi Lal Singh | 396096877232731 on February 11 , 2015 , 0 : 55 GMT India has lack of confidence but still enough to beat Pakistan kc69 on February 10 , 2015 , 19 : 51 GMT This is the problem with Pakistan they take their encounter with India as a matter of pride , jump guns and when they lose they performance level drops further in next matches.As an Indian fan I just see it as a group stage match and winning World cup is bigger than defeating Pakistan.Waqar should remember one thing that he himself builds pressure on their team and expectations with their fans with such statements and then claim that MSD handled pressure better.Look at team India and MSD they dont make a big thing out of this.May the team playing better cricket win . smalishah84 on February 10 , 2015 , 16 : 42 GMT This is the worst Pakistan team ever going into a world cup. As a Pakistani fan I am hoping for a miracle but I have serious doubts. The only thing I can foresee is Pakistan getting the Indian batsmen such as Dhoni and Co back in form. Also it might be a good time for Indian bowlers to get their confidence in with such a pathetic batting line up from Pakistan. Cheers apshah63 on February 10 , 2015 , 13 : 18 GMT Looking at the performance of Indian team , Waqar 's hopes are not false. However , if India manages a win , they will pose serious threat to others . on February 10 , 2015 , 12 : 25 GMT i think s afridi looks dangerous , and india is low on confidence , they hvnt settle yet so it seems 60 : 40 pak/ind , best of luck for both teams on February 10 , 2015 , 12 : 22 GMT I think S afridi looks very dangerous and india is very low on confidence and they hvnt settle yet , so it could be 60 : 40 pak/ ind , best of luck for both teams on February 10 , 2015 , 11 : 42 GMT Given Indias current form and lack of good bowling options , it is possible. But the World Cup is about beating other teams as well. No use beating the rival and doing badly after that . on February 10 , 2015 , 10 : 08 GMT Pakistan has never beaten India in a World Cup Match and it ai n't happening now. You should be glad that you are meeting them in round robin rather than elimination round. I still cant understand how you left out Shoaib Malik , Saeed Ajmal , Fawad Alam and Kamran Akmal. India will regret leaving Yuvraj Singh , he has always played well in competitive tournaments. Also , he likes the ball to come onto the bat . HusnainQ on February 10 , 2015 , 8 : 37 GMT Keep dreaming - lets hope Pak does n't fall in the last place in the group wapuser on February 10 , 2015 , 5 : 49 GMT It will be nice to beat india Popular Videos
