Pakistan fights to retain position while New Zealand eyes rankings progression Pakistan currently holds a slender two-point advantage over the Black Caps New Zealand spinner Anton Devcich ( R ) delivers the ball as Pakistani batsman Sarfraz Ahmed looks on . Pakistan will put its number six ranking on the line as New Zealand aims to climb the Reliance ICC ODI Team Rankings in their five-match series in United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) , which starts at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Monday . Pakistan currently holds a slender two-point advantage over the Black Caps , who have a chance to not only move clear of West Indies on 96 points but also leapfrog Pakistan into sixth position should it win the series convincingly . Depending on results in the ongoing Sri Lanka and England series , where the host currently holds a 2-1 lead ahead of the fourth ODI , Pakistan has a chance to gain valuable rankings points and put pressure on England , which holds an eight-point advantage over Pakistan . However , Pakistan will need to win the series by a margin of at least 3-2 to retain its sixth position. On the other hand , if New Zealand was to win the series by a margin of 3-2 , it will overtake its opponent by a fraction , but will share the sixth place. If the margin of victory is 4-1 in favour of the Blackcaps , then it will displace Pakistan from sixth position . With many permutations dependent on results elsewhere , all of the competing sides have an opportunity to progress ahead of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 , which commences on 14 February.
