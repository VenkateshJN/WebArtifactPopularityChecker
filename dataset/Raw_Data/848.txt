The bowlers have really stepped up , and in a team sport it starts to reflect in other departments too. We dropped one catch today but the fielding has been brilliant. When we are losing quite a few games outside the subcontinent , it was an area of concern that we were not getting wickets in the middle overs. Now we are getting wickets with the new ball and the spinners are able to put more pressure on the batsmen in the middle overs. We have to continue with the good effort. [ Bhuvneshwar ] looked good , first five overs he bowled he was looking sharper than he did when he came back from the injury and played the Test match. If he plays a few more games , we can see how he can bowl in the death overs also . 04.32 ( IST ) : Ravichandran Ashwin : I bowl at such phases of the game , it 's more of cutting the runs out , it can get a little difficult , but [ the lack of a four-wicket haul ] was playing on my mind today after the first five overs. When it comes to this format , I 'm pretty much unselfish , it does n't matter if I get the numbers or not as long as I put in the effort required. My wrist is getting into a good position , and that helps with the arm ball , the breeze helped as well.
