World Cup 2015 January 22 , 2015 Malinga on track to play in World Cup shares 18 Lasith Malinga has now sufficiently recovered to begin bowling in the nets again © AFP Lasith Malinga remains on track to play in the 2015 World Cup , despite having suffered a minor setback in his recovery from ankle surgery , Sri Lanka team manager Michael de Zoysa has confirmed. Malinga had experienced pain in his left ankle after he had begun to bowl off a short run-up in December , but he has now sufficiently recovered to begin bowling in the nets again . " He 's been bowling all week , and is on track to play the warm-up games before the World Cup , " de Zoysa said. " Whether he plays in the one-dayers against New Zealand is another matter , but there is a chance. We 'll be careful not to rush him. We 've bought some ultrasound equipment to help with his recovery as well. " Malinga had had arthroscopic surgery in September , after a long-term ankle injury had deteriorated significantly in mid-2014. The surgery was expected to take 16 weeks to recover from , and though he was seen bowling at a reduced pace at the Khettarama Stadium nets during England 's ODI tour of Sri Lanka in November and December , he had since returned for a consultation with his orthopaedic surgeon in Melbourne after suffering pain in the ankle . Despite this , the team remains optimistic he will return to full fitness over the next few weeks , with teammate Mahela Jayawardene also tweeting he was " confident [ Malinga ] will be ready for WC " . Sri Lanka have relied heavily on Malinga to lead the attack in recent years. They play their first warm-up match against South Africa on February 9. Their first tournament match is the curtain-raiser against New Zealand on February 14 . Andrew Fidel Fernando is ESPNcricinfo 's Sri Lanka correspondent. @ andrewffernando © ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
