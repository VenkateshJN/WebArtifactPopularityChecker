While the world was busy watching the World Cup semifinal between New Zealand and South Africa , Delhi started their T20 campaign in style with a 26-run win over Jammu & Kashmir in the Syed Mustaq Ali Trophy North Zone match here at the Ferozshah Kotla . Put in to bat first , Delhi , who were without the services of Varun Sood and Parwinder Awana , posted a total of 159/7 in 20 overs thanks to a splendid 85 ( 50b ) by Sehwag , who hit seven fours and five huge sixes . Off to a poor start , Delhi lost their skipper Gautam Gambhir for just 10 with the scoreboard reading 41/2. Then , both Nitish Rana ( 5 ) and Milind Kumar ( 1 ) fell in quick succession and Delhi were struggling at 67/4. However , a 72-run fifth-wicket partnership between Sehwag and Vaibhav Rawal ( 39 not out ) put Delhi back on track before Sehwag hit straight into the hands of Umar Nazir at deep mid-wicket . In reply , J&K batsmen Adil Reshi and Ian Chauhan shared a 75-run second-wicket partnership. While the two were at the crease , the target seemed well within reach. The duo had special treatment reserved for Pawan Suyal and Milind Kumar. The Delhi bowlers were being hammered all over the park until Reshi nicked one back to wicketkeeper Unmukt Chand off Vikas Tokas ( 2-31 ) . Parvez Rasool ( 10 ) started well but caught plumb in front off Manan Sharma. From there on , J&K 's wickets fells like a pack of cards . Brief Scores : Delhi 159/6 in 20 overs ( Sehwag 85 ; Nazir 2-19 ) beat J&K 133/7 in 20 overs ( Reshi 47 ; Negi 2-30 ) Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
