IPL 2015 : Rajasthan Royals preview April 6 , 2015 Homeless Royals eye sustained intensity Rajasthan Royals team preview Likely first XI 1 Ajinkya Rahane , 2 Karun Nair , 3 Steven Smith , 4 Sanju Samson ( wk ) , 5 Shane Watson ( capt ) , 6 Stuart Binny , 7 James Faulkner , 8 Chris Morris/Tim Southee/Juan Theron , 9 Rajat Bhatia , 10 Pravin Tambe , 11 Dhawal Kulkarni Click here for the full squad 2014 finish Botched up a strong start to finish fifth . Big picture For a team that has often delivered more than promised , Rajasthan Royals left fans exasperated at the end of the last season. Royals usually build themselves up incrementally , hitting top gear as the tournament reaches the business end , but when they sprinted to six wins in nine games - they were ahead of eventual champions Kolkata Knight Riders at that stage - a place in the knockouts seemed within reach. They did n't , however , qualify. In the last league game against Mumbai , despite the insurance of a tall total behind them , their bowlers wilted en masse . The story of their 2014 campaign was n't so much about implosion as the effect of relentlessly shuffling personnel : 22 players took the field for Royals , the highest for any team last year. Add to this the less-than-optimal utilisation of Steven Smith and James Faulkner , and you can see how a promising plot went kaput . They were typically prudent with their budget in the 2015 auction , finishing with an unspent sum of Rs 10.65 crore ( approx. $ 1.77 million ) from the allotted purse of Rs 63 crore . Paddy Upton , the side 's head coach , said Chris Morris , Royals ' costliest buy at Rs 1.4 crore ( approx $ 233,000 ) , was acquired for his all-round skills and to enable his pairing with another allrounder , James Faulkner. With the ball , Morris produced a record performance for Lions in the Ram Slam T20 last year. With captain Shane Watson and Stuart Binny playing all-round roles as well , Morris ' inclusion leaves Royals " with lots of options. " They have also brought in two legspinners in Dinesh Salunkhe and Pardeep Sahu , recognising that such bowlers are becoming a " valuable asset in this format. " Since their victory in the inaugural edition , they have n't done enough to consistently be serious contenders for the title , and this year is another opportunity at correcting that. To do so , they will need a versatile unit , especially with them not playing in Jaipur for the second year in succession ; their home fixtures have instead been drawn up at two venues : the Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad and the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai . Big players Last season , Smith was seen as an exciting batting talent , whose breathtaking attempts on the field made for great highlight reels. This season , he returns to the IPL on the back of a remarkable run of form. In the past year , he has scored 2096 runs in 31 international matches across formats at 69.86 , including eight hundreds. During this period , he captained Australia 's Test side and was also the leading run-scorer ( 402 at an average of 67 , including an unbeaten fifty in the final ) in their victorious World Cup campaign. The Royals management would likely want him to take ownership of the No.3 spot , and replicate the success he has had for Australia in the position . Like Smith , Faulkner , too , has enhanced his credentials over the last two years. His audacious finishing skills with the bat and slippery back-of-the-hand deliveries make him important to the team 's balance. There were question-marks over his death-bowling skills last year - his economy rate of 9.74 was the poorest in the team - but he has strengthened this area in recent times . Bargain buy Juan Theron had a memorable IPL debut , producing a nerveless spell to bowl Kings XI Punjab to a victory against Chennai Super Kings. A seasoned player in the T20 format with strong death-bowling skills , Theron 's inclusion at Rs 30 lakh ( $ 50,000 ) looks like a smart deal . Availability Kane Richardson has opted out of the IPL citing personal reasons. Tim Southee will miss the last phase of the tournament with New Zealand touring England in May . Coaches Mentor - Rahul Dravid , Head coach - Paddy Upton , Director of cricket - Zubin Bharucha , Coach - Monty Desai Quote " When we pick players , we look a lot at their Ranji Trophy performance as well. Of course there are specific T20 skills that we are looking for but we also want to see hunger , we also want to see consistency and we also want to see somebody who can deliver under pressure.

OLDEST BRUTALANALYST on April 7 , 2015 , 17 : 01 GMT i think RR should back Theron hes a dynamic fielder but more importantly has some of the best yorkers around . Junaid Ansari on April 7 , 2015 , 15 : 58 GMT My favroute team , go RR and rock these IPL enlightenedone on April 7 , 2015 , 14 : 44 GMT Watson should open and Faulkner should play ahead of binny on April 7 , 2015 , 14 : 05 GMT What was the reason for Dravid chopping and changing the team last year ? ? ? I hope he has understood that excessive experimentation is counterproductive . on April 7 , 2015 , 12 : 57 GMT Rajasthan Royals never looked great bowling unit to me. They donot have any threatening bowler like Malinga , Starc,etc. Though James faulkner has done good job for Aus during this World Cup. But still I think he may not be that effective in Indian condition and small grounds. I dont understand why every time Rajasthan Royals go for so many allrounders like Binny , Watto , Faulkner , Morris. I think Ideal T20 side should be with 5 Batters , 2 All-Rounder and 4 Bowlers. So looking at their side , I think they will finish at 5th position this year. If somehow they qualified for playoff ( which I think difficult ) still they wont able to make in the finals. I love RR for Dravid and Ajju. I dont understand why they come up with " Moneysaving Policy " every years auction. Best of luck RR on April 7 , 2015 , 8 : 42 GMT RR have very young talented & experiance batting line up. They have players like watto smith rahane southy faulkner are match winners,they proved in world cup so RR is team to beat for any team.all the best Yasin123Patel on April 7 , 2015 , 5 : 22 GMT RR needs to stick with the batting Order that once they decide. Perfect team but lacks , Out and out Big consistent hitter like Maxwell and Bowling also looks slightly weaker , depends lot on All rounders. Though they have good depth in batting so Rahane should play bit aggressively this time at the top . srinivasan1317 on April 7 , 2015 , 5 : 08 GMT I 'm more interested in Karun Nair who did brilliantly for Karnataka in the domestic season. He was a very good buy for RR. Hopefully , RR should be there in the last four this time . on April 7 , 2015 , 1 : 07 GMT May want to play more batsmen - Unmukt Chand can be given a chance or two. But Nair , Samson , Rahane , Watto , Smith , Faulkner , Binny are the top 7 ( with 3 all rounders ) . They can add pick Tambe and one from Theron/Southee/Morris. Even if they add another pacer in Kulkarni , Bhatia or Malik , that leaves one spot - should try young batsmen - will give them bating depth down to 8th place . vkumar_086 on April 6 , 2015 , 20 : 46 GMT RR is known for fielding young Indian talents...they gel as a unit & get the help of overseas players...Smith & Faulkner will play key roles.. .

Rahane , Watson , Samson , Smith , Binny , Faulkner,Morris/Southee , Bhatia , Dhawal Kulkarni , Tambe , V.Malik on April 6 , 2015 , 20 : 01 GMT Deepak Hooda should play , the bright young talent from Baroda on April 6 , 2015 , 15 : 52 GMT Watto opens no mattter wat,even if it means a complete shuffle in the line up.He may not be in the best of form but on any given day i would back him to take the game away from the opposition than a rahane or samson or nair.ideally the line up should be 1 ) watto2 ) rahane3 ) nair4 ) smith5 ) samson ( use him as a pinch hitter he can really do a good job with it ) 6 ) faulkner7 ) binny8 ) bhatia9 ) southee/morris ( though cutting is a dangeorus hitter down the order his bowling demands improvement ) 10 ) kulkarni11 ) tambe . Pradeep Gowda on April 6 , 2015 , 15 : 48 GMT rr should play hooda he is very good all rounder. Playing 11 should be karun rahane Smith sanju watto binny hooda faulkener Morris tambe dawal/bhatiya. This 11 has better depth in batting and bowling mukesh132mishra on April 6 , 2015 , 15 : 33 GMT RR have some very good alrounders in their line up , which is like gold. But they look thin in batting department. I do n't see much of quality in their bench strength. The key would be to not lose any players to injury. Having said that , if the original choices are available , they are an exciting unit. All the best RR baghels.a on April 6 , 2015 , 14 : 38 GMT There is a lot of talk about India u-19 batting allrounder Deepak Hooda who had an excellent debut season with Baroda in Ranji and Vijay Hajare Trophy ,will he get a go in the starting XI this season ? ? Sampath Kumar Ch on April 6 , 2015 , 14 : 07 GMT Royals has the Best All rounders but have to wait n see how far they can turn it as a Winning team CricketChat on April 6 , 2015 , 13 : 56 GMT RR 's fortunes have brightened this year with Steve Smith and Faulkner 's form in purple patch. They need good backups for Binny and old horse Bhatia , the two weak links in the team. Also , they do n't have an explosive openers to propel them to good starts in first 5-6 overs. Rahane is OK , but Nair is untested . Indi.boy28 on April 6 , 2015 , 13 : 44 GMT Trio of Australia 's World Cup heroes are in Rajasthan Royals side. Smith & Faulkner will play vital role in RR victories ahead in this IPL season. Both are great players & in superb form one is best middle order batsman right now & second one is best finisher esp. with ball. Gud luck RR. . on April 6 , 2015 , 13 : 40 GMT Samson at 3 and Smith at 4 would be better for d royals and i want to see Ben cutting playing more games this season on April 6 , 2015 , 12 : 09 GMT Steve Smith should come up the order. There is no way to play him as finisher as he is wasted there. My Royals XI : Karun , Samson , Smith , Rahane , Watson , Binny , Faulkner , Bhatia , Morris , Kulkarni & Tambe. If play according to potential and not botched up like last season , can reached to play-offs.
