Play 01 : 23 Bravo : We wanted Kallis as first pick Allrounders Shahid Afridi and Jacques Kallis , batsmen Mahela Jayawardene and Ross Taylor , and fast bowler Lasith Malinga were the highest-profile overseas players picked at the Caribbean Premier League 2015 's players draft , in Jamaica. Afridi , in the top grade of the 11 payment brackets at the draft , was claimed by the league 's new franchise from St Kitts and Nevis . Kallis went to Trinidad & Tobago Red Steel , Jayawardene to Jamaica Tallawahs , Taylor to St Lucia Zouks and Malinga to Guyana Amazon Warriors. Marlon Samuels was among the biggest local names in the draft - several others were retained by their franchises before the draft - and he was claimed by St Kitts and Nevis. The St Kitts and Nevis franchise , which replaces Antigua Hawksbills in the competition and were allowed to retain four of the Antigua squad , have also announced that they will be coached by South African Eric Simons , who has worked with Delhi Daredevils and the Indian team in coaching roles . The teams have 24 hours after the end of the draft to exchange a player with another franchise , but they can indulge in only one such switch .
