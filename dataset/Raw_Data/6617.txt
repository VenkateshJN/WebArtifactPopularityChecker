Players who had a starring role in the only World Cup that they played shares 24 Peter Kirsten , at the age of 37 , dominated what was then a young man 's game © Getty Images South Africa 1992 Kirsten was 37 years old by the time he played his first and only World Cup , in 1992. South Africa could not play the first four World Cups because they were suspended by the ICC between 1970 and 1991 due the government 's policy of apartheid. Kirsten was the third-highest run getter in that edition , scoring 410 runs , including four fifties , at an average of 68.3 . Geoff Allott 's 20-wicket haul was , at the time , a record for the most wickets in a World Cup © AFP New Zealand 1999 Allott was the leading wicket-taker at the 1999 World Cup , picking up 20 wickets at an average of 16.3. He is the only New Zealand bowler to have topped the wickets tally at any edition of the World Cup. However , a series of injuries , primarily a persistent back problem , meant that Allott would play his last international match in 2000 , at the relatively young age of 29 . Neil Johnson is one of only two players to score 350 runs and take ten wickets in the same World Cup © Getty Images Zimbabwe 1999 Johnson had a starring role with both bat and ball during the 1999 World Cup , scoring 367 runs at an average of 52.4 , including a hundred and three fifties , while also picking up 12 wickets along the way. He had three Man-of-the-Match citations to show for his efforts. However , Johnson left for South Africa in 2000 thanks to differences with coach Dave Houghton and low pay offers from the Zimbabwe Cricket Union . Andy Bichel contributed with bat and ball during the 2003 World Cup © Reuters Australia 2003 During the 2003 World Cup , Bichel picked up 16 wickets at an average of 12.3 , the best for any bowler who had taken at least ten wickets. During that edition , he was also part of Australia 's two best lower-order stands ( eighth to tenth wickets ) in all World Cups , sharing 73 * and 97-run partnerships with Michael Bevan. Despite this , Bichel 's contract was not renewed in 2004 , which meant that he was an ODI regular in that strong Australia team for only a brief period between 2002 and 2004 . Gary Gilmour bagged five-wicket hauls in the only two World Cup matches that he ever played © Patrick Eagar Australia 1975 Gary Gilmour did n't play a game in the 1975 tournament till the semi-final , after which he left an indelible mark on the tournament 's history. He returned figures of 6 for 14 in the semi-final against England and 5 for 48 in the final against West Indies. Glenn McGrath , the highest wicket-taker in World Cups , has only two five-fors from 39 games. Injuries , a dearth of ODIs and poor fitness meant that Gilmour played only one ODI after the 1975 final . © ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
