( Related : Dhoni joins Team India in Australia ) Ishant has previously been a part of two Test tours in 2007-08 and then in 2011-12 . " All our bowlers are in the same age group , an average age of 26 or 27 , which is very good for the Indian team , " Ishant told reporters on Saturday. ( Also read : Zaheer Khan says he is not shocked by World Cup snub ) " As such , I do n't see myself as a role model for anyone. What I need to do is focus on my bowling and then whatever I have learnt from my experiences in the past and tours abroad that I can share with my team mates. It is vital to learn from whatever we did right on past tours , focus on that and keep doing the same. " Ishant had first shot to fame during the 2007-08 tour when he had consistently troubled Australian captain Ricky Ponting. On the subsequent tour in 2011-12 , he did n't do too well as India lost 0-4 in the Test series . Ishant 's own record took a battering as he now has played 7 Tests in Australia , with 11 wickets at an average of 70-plus . " I learnt an important lesson last time. There were a lot of expectations from me and I have a lot of expectations from myself. I got recognition in Australia but could n't live up to it the last time. This time I know I have to control my feelings and expectations. I have to focus on doing the basics right. So I can concentrate better and improve my bowling , " he said .
