( PTI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 Everyone knows that Sachin Tendulkar made his debut for India against Pakistan in 1989 , but did you know that he actually got his first taste of international cricket two years earlier , not playing for India but for a Pakistan team - against India ! During Pakistan 's tour of India in 1987 , Sachin was sent in as a substitute fielder for Imran Khan 's team during a festival match with India at Mumbai 's Brabourne stadium . Javed Miandad and Abdul Qadir left the field at lunch time and Sachin was asked to field. Imran deployed him at long-on and soon Kapil Dev hit a skier in his direction. Despite running 15 metres , Sachin could not reach the ball . Recounting the incident in his recently released book , 'Playing it My Way ' , Sachin remembers complaining to a friend later that he could have taken the catch had he been positioned at mid-on instead of long-on . " I do n't know whether Imran Khan remembers this or has any idea that I once fielded for his Pakistan team , " writes Sachin in his book .
