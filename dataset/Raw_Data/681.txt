Â© AP London : England wicketkeeper Craig Kieswetter 's hopes of going to the World Cup next year have been dashed after he admitted the eye damaged in a county match last season had not healed properly . The 27-year-old South Africa-born player -- who was named in England 's preliminary squad for the World Cup which gets underway in February in Australia and New Zealand -- may well miss the whole of the 2015 season . Kieswetter , who has played 46 times for the England one-day side , suffered a broken nose , a damaged eye socket and cheekbone when a ball crept through the grille of his helmet playing for his county Somerset against Northamptonshire last July . Somerset have said Kieswetter 's long-term prognosis is unknown but he is " unlikely " to be fit for next year . Kieswetter released a statement in which he explained his eyesight was still not 100 percent despite recently playing in South Africa 's Twenty20 competition . " It is really disappointing but my eye is not 100 % and this of course is critical in maintaining the levels of performance that I expect of myself . " I need to make every effort to resolve the matter and have the best specialist help in that regard.
