He has not only an excellent control over bat , but also on his temperament. He has always shown professional gesture and never posed over ambitious or insulting. Cool and sharp minded individual. I like Dhoni and Misbah for their temperaments .

Boycott is correct too , about MS Dhoni - MS was the best captain in the world , even when he retired - I think that he has retired prematurely , maybe because of his detractors. I advise him to return to test cricket - the sport misses him. Amla and De Villiers have already included their names among the All Time test greats. And along with Viv Richards , both are also the best ODI batsmen ever. I back Kohli to be right up there after he has played enough matches whereby he can be judged. Sangakkara is a wonderful player ; but he has some scores to settle in the West Indies to be picked among the All Time test greats. He toured us twice and has not scored a 100 ; and his average in under 35 in WI. One doubts calling a player an All Time great if he tours any country not once , but TWICE and still di n't score a 100 ; while only averaging under 35. Scoring a 100 in every country is important .
