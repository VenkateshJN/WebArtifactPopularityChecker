Mashrafe was fined 40 per cent of his match fee , while his players received 20 per cent fines . " For a captain to be suspended , he must commit two minor over-rate offences or one serious over rate offence during the event , " said an ICC statement . " Therefore , if Mashrafe is found guilty of one more minor over-rate offence during the World Cup while acting as captain , he will receive a one-match suspension during the event.
