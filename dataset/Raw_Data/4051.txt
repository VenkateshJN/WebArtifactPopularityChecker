No Ravi Shastri , no 'aerial routes ' from the commentary box The author has posted comments on this article Pratyush Patra , TNN | Feb 25 , 2015 , 11.31AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 Courtesy his new role as the team director , former Indian cricketer Ravi Shastri is now not a part of the commentary team this World Cup . Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 However , the Gen Y is more acquainted with his oratory skills than his batting or bowling prowess. The man with the microphone , mostly seen during presentation ceremonies , is known for his ability to leave the audience in splits with his habit of stating the obvious . His overused 'cool customer ' for every player who is not losing his head and 'pressure cooker ' situation for any tense moment in the game will probably be inducted by ICC if it ever comes up with a cricket lexicon. There are lines that he will utter and the listener will be left in disbelief . Sample this : " The next few overs will be crucial. " Which overs in a T20 game are usually not crucial , Mr Shastri ? His similes like 'tracer bullet ' for a speeding ball or idioms like 'That 's exactly what the doctor ordered ' have the potency to change the cricketing lingo and are only next to Navjot Singh Sidhu 's Sidhuism gems like 'Statistics are like miniskirts , they reveal more than what they hide' . In the absence of these two cricketer-turned-commentators , we have only Rameez Raja to turn to for some fun. Raza 's lines like 'Hafeez is pushing smoothly. His partner Jamshed is satisfied today ' or 'Misbah looked cool from the exterior , do n't know about the interior ' can leave any cricketer red-faced .
