Â© AFP Clarke missed a large portion of the India-Australia Test series after injuring his back. Prone to injuries , Clarke put his career in jeopardy and several saw the upcoming World Cup as his swansong. According to a report in Fox Sports , Clarke has swept away any talk of retirement . " It 's funny , a lot of people have said or thought Michael is going to retire at the end of this World Cup , " Clarke said. " I 'm sure I am going to retire at the end of a World Cup , but I do n't think it 's this one . " I 'm 33-years of age , look at someone like Brad Haddin who is 37 and still loving his cricket and contributing to the team. I do n't see any reason why I ca n't play in the next World Cup. " Clarke returned to nets at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Wednesday and is racing against time to be fit for the World Cup. George Bailey will lead in his absence . " The boys are playing at the SCG so I 'll go and bat again. It will be restricted , but I 'm hoping I can just continually build it up over the next few weeks , " Clarke said . " I 'm going to struggle for the first game of the World Cup. The reason I can say that in advance now is because the surgeon feels there 's a certain time frame my hamstring needs before he feels comfortable . " At the moment I 'm following the Australian medical staff rehab program but a lot of that is dictated by the surgeon . " I 'm flying to Melbourne on Saturday to see the surgeon on Sunday. Time-frame wise I 'm really confident I 'll be right to go at 100 per cent in the not too distant future.
