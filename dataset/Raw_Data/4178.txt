Electing to bat at Gujarat College 'B ' ground in Ahmedabad , UCC were in a soup right from the word go as RSCC bowlers made life tough for them . Utkarsh Dave was the pick of the lot with three wickets while Viral Shah and Ujawal Mishra took two wickets each as RSCC bowled out their rivals for a paltry 95 in just 32.2 overs . For UCC , Harsh Pancholi waged a lone battle with 36-ball 28 while all the other batsmen failed to even put up a fight . Krutarth Shah then scored an unbeaten 48-ball 36 while Dharmraj Sodha added 27 off 37 balls as RSCC reached the target in 19 overs losing two wickets to win the match . In another match , Ronak Patel scored a brilliant century for his team New Cloth Market ( NCM ) as they edged out Mandavi ni pole CC ( MNPCC ) in a thriller by 11 runs. Ronak starred with 87-ball 107 while Azaz Pathan added 50 more off 73 balls to help NCM post 264 for nine in their 40 overs . Mahavir then led the chase with 37-ball 47 while Rohit Yadav ( 45 off 35 balls ) and Devendra Hirani ( 43 not out off 40 balls ) too chipped in but that effort was not enough as MNPCC managed to post 253 for nine in 40 overs to fall short of the target .
