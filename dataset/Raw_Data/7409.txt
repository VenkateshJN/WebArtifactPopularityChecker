A prolific year for batting captains A year in which New Zealand shone , Test cricket produced results , and India 's bowlers struggled S Rajesh January 2 , 2015 Players/Officials Kumar Sangakkara Brendon McCullum James Anderson Mitchell Johnson Angelo Mathews Dale Steyn Kane Williamson The lack of draws Till the last day of cricket in 2014 , there had been only six draws in 39 Tests in the year - the last time there had been fewer draws in a calendar year was 1970 , when only six Tests were played , of which two were drawn. As it turned out , the last day of cricket added 33 % to the number of draws , as India held on at the MCG , and the weather played spoilsport in Port Elizabeth. That increased the number of draws in 2014 to eight , which is still a nice and low number , given that 41 Tests were played this year. In terms of percentages , there has been only one year with fewer stalemates : in 2002 , eight out of 54 Tests were drawn , a percentage of 14.81. In that year , Pakistan played 12 Tests without a single draw , Australia played 11 , and South Africa nine , with none of them being draws . Last year was highly skewed in favour of home teams - there were only two wins by touring teams ( excluding matches in neutral venues ) - but the balance was redressed somewhat in 2014 , with nine wins for touring teams. A 9-18 win-loss record was much better than the 2-29 of 2013 , but it still was n't as even as in some of the previous years : it had been 13-13 in 2011 , and 14-16 in 2010. Among the nine away wins in 2014 were two by Australia in South Africa , one by South Africa in Sri Lanka , and one by Sri Lanka in England. Even India won an away Test , at Lord 's , before slumping in the rest of the series . Despite the fewer draws , the overall batting average went up in 2014 to 35.96 , from 32.17 last year , an increase of almost 12 % . The scoring rates went up too , from 3.13 to 3.27 . Lowest draw percentages in a calendar year since 1970 Year 33.53 3.38 In ODIs , the highlight was a run rate that kept moving upward. The 2014 ODI run rate was 5.29 , the highest it has ever been in a calendar year ; the previous best was 5.12 in 2009. The matches in India , New Zealand and Sri Lanka contributed heavily to the high scoring rate - the eight ODIs in India had a rate of 5.86 , while New Zealand and Sri Lanka both had rates in excess of 5.50. There were 31 totals of 300 or more , with the highest being India 's 404 against Sri Lanka in Kolkata in November . Highest run rates in a calendar year in ODIs Year 18 The teams that stood out More incredible than India 's 404 , though , was what happened on the first day of 2014 , in an ODI in Queenstown . In a match reduced to 21 overs per side , New Zealand blasted 283 , riding on a 36-ball century from Corey Anderson , the fastest in ODI history . That turned out to be a harbinger of things to come in the rest of the year for New Zealand , in both forms of the game . In Tests , they won five in 2014 , their best performance ever . They 've won four in a year only five times , and the last of those was in 2008 , when three out of four wins were against Bangladesh. Two other teams won five Tests in 2014 - Australia and Sri Lanka - but both lost three , to New Zealand 's two , which means New Zealand had the best win-loss ratio for the year. Apart from Zimbabwe , the team with the worst win-loss ratio was India - one win and six defeats , which was a function of the fact that they played all their Tests overseas. They were the only team , excluding Zimbabwe , to lose more Tests than they won in 2014 . In both Tests and ODIs , New Zealand , Australia and South Africa were among the teams with the three best win-loss ratios - conclusive proof that 2014 was a terrific year for teams from the southern hemisphere . Test and ODI records for teams in 2014 0.23 The best batsmen Much of the reason for New Zealand 's superb performance in Tests in 2014 was the batting of Brendon McCullum and Kane Williamson , and the consistency of Trent Boult and Tim Southee with the ball. Before 2014 , the most runs McCullum had scored in a year was 764 , in 2008 ; it took him 24 innings to score those runs. Last year , in just 16 innings , he amassed 1164 , at an average of 72.75. It 's the first instance of a New Zealand batsman scoring 1000 Test runs in a calendar year. Williamson was almost as prolific , with 929 runs at an average of 61.93. Before 2014 , the highest in a calendar year for New Zealand was John Reid 's 871 runs in 24 innings in 1965. In 2014 , not only was a record that stood for almost 50 years broken , it was broken by two batsmen , and both played stellar roles in New Zealand 's bumper year in Tests . Sri Lanka won five Tests too in 2014 , and their batting stars were Kumar Sangakkara and Angelo Mathews. Sangakkara , with 1493 runs at 71.09 , was the leading run-scorer in Tests last year. He made two scores of 200 or more , including 319 against Bangladesh in Chittagong. In three innings against Bangladesh , Sangakkara made 499 runs , but even excluding those runs , he made 994 runs in 2014 at an average of 55.22. Mathews was the second highest run-scorer , with 1317 at an average of 87.80. Mahela Jayawardene made more than 1000 too , which meant Sri Lanka was the only side with three batsmen scoring 1000-plus Test runs. Australia were well-represented too , with Steven Smith and David Warner in the club , while Younis Khan was Pakistan 's only representative . Sangakkara and Mathews were also the leading run-scorers in ODIs in 2014 , and they were two of only three batsmen to make 1000-plus ODI runs in the year. Virat Kohli redeemed his Test year with runs in Australia , and in ODIs he was the third batsman with 1000-plus runs , scoring 1054 off 1058 balls , at an average of 58.55 . A peculiar feature of 2014 was the batting form of captains in Tests. McCullum and Mathews had stunning years , Misbah-ul-Haq made 747 runs at an average of 57.46 , while Hashim Amla 's 442 runs as captain came at an average of 73.66. Smith and Kohli only started their captaincy stints , but both made massive runs when leading their teams : Smith made two hundreds in two Tests , while Kohli scored a century in each innings in Adelaide. Together all of those runs made up for the relative failures of some others - most notably Michael Clarke 's 429 runs at 35.75 , and Alastair Cook 's 390 at 32.50 - and ensured that captains averaged 49.40 with the bat in 2014. Since 1980 , there have been only two years when they have averaged more - 1990 and 2009 . Best years for captains with the bat in Tests since 1980 Year
