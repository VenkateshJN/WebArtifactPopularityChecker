Both teams share a point each . Cyclone Marcia lashed Brisbane on Thursday evening and there were already doubts whether the match would take place. Australia abandoned their training session on Friday with Michael Clarke , who was making a comeback after hamstring surgery , keeping the makeup of his team under wraps . On Saturday morning , rain continued to lash the city and the groundstaff struggled to get the ground ready. The teams did not leave their hotel and chances of play looked grim. The cut-off time for a 20-over game was 18 : 30 local time but the rain refused to relent and the match was abandoned at 16 : 40 local time . Thanks to this abandoned game , both teams have three points from two games. Australia registered a victory over England in their opening game of the tournament in Melbourne while Bangladesh achieved a 105-run victory over Afghanistan in Canberra. The result increases pressure on England , who are languishing at the bottom of the table with two losses and a poor net run-rate . Australia 's next game is against New Zealand in Auckland on February 28 while Bangladesh take on Sri Lanka in Melbourne in an important game on February 26 . © Cricbuzz Tags
