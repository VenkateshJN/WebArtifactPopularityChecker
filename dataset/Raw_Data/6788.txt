World Cup 2015 : Pakistan February 27 , 2015 Shehzad likely to be fit for Zimbabwe clash ESPNcricinfo staff shares 55 Ahmed Shehzad had complained of acute pain in the region of the left Achilles ' tendon © Getty Images Pakistan opener Ahmed Shehzad is likely to recover in time from a minor ankle injury to take the field against Zimbabwe on March 1. A PCB release said that Shehzad had " complained of acute pain in the region of the left Achilles ' tendon during a fielding training session " on Thursday . However , Brad Robinson , the team physiotherapist , confirmed that scans showed no serious damage. " Ahmed had an MRI in Brisbane this morning. The results showed a slight retrocalcaneal bursitis ( inflammed bursa ) between the Achilles ' tendon and the calcaneus ( heel bone ) . The Achilles ' tendon was intact and undamaged. As the tendon is not involved I am confident he will be available to play against Zimbabwe on the March 1 , " Robinson said . " Ahmed is receiving the appropriate treatment involving regular ice therapy , topical and oral anti-inflammatory medication and a heel-raise to offload the area. An ultrasound guided injection is not advised at this stage as he would require a four-day rest period following such an infiltration. He will be closely monitored over the next week " Shehzad has had an ordinary outing so far , with just 48 runs from two matches , but his availability will nonetheless come as a boost to a Pakistan side struggling for confidence and currently rooted to the bottom of Pool B . © ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
