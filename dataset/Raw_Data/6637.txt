World Cup 2015 February 5 , 2015 Rahat Ali picked as Junaid Khan replacement ESPNcricinfo staff 247 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Comment shares 247 The PCB has picked seamer Rahat Ali as a replacement for the injured Junaid Khan in Pakistan 's World Cup squad. The ICC 's technical committee approved the switch. * The selection of Ali , who has played only one ODI in a seven-year List A career and no international game since the Sharjah Test against New Zealand in November , was approved by PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan on the recommendation of chief selector Moin Khan . Junaid was ruled out of the World Cup after failing a fitness test in Lahore earlier this week. He had already pulled out of the recently-concluded two-match ODI series against New Zealand due to a thigh injury sustained during training in Lahore in January and , despite undergoing a rigorous rehabilitation programme at the National Cricket Academy , could not regain full fitness in time. In October he had picked up a knee injury and was ruled out of Pakistan 's entire international winter season in the UAE. He recovered from that injury to make the World Cup squad , but then he had a fall while bowling in the nets in Lahore . Ali has played 11 Tests - aside from his solitary ODI , which was way back in June 2012 against Sri Lanka - picking 31 wickets at 36.67. In this season 's domestic one-day competition , the President 's Gold Cup One Day , where he plays for Khan Research Laboratories , he has eight wickets at 32.37 . * 0825GMT , February 6 : This article was updated after the ICC approved Rahat Ali 's inclusion .
