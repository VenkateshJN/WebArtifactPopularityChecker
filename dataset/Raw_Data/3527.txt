It is learnt an amount of about Rs 4 crore has been fixed in the bank. On learning the development , Dev chose to inform the police and the bank . " I am a director of DDCA and according to company law , I need to be informed about any transaction. Nothing of that sort happened. I do n't want to put my neck into all this. If any discrepancy happens with this account , I have nothing to do with it , " Dev said . Chauhan defended his decision saying , " 16 members of the executive committee approved the decision. We had to create a new bank account since all the alleged misappropriation happened through the last account.
