( Reuters Photo ) Page 1 of 4 AUCKLAND : South Africa 's four-wicket defeat by New Zealand at Auckland 's Eden Park was their fourth loss in as many World Cup semifinals , with the Proteas still to make it to the tournament 's showpiece match . Below we look back at their quartet of last-four losses : 1992 , SCG : South Africa 232-6 lost to England 252-6 ( G Hick 83 ) by 19 runs ( revised target ) South Africa , having being allowed into their first World Cup in the run-up to the end of apartheid , were on the cusp of a fairytale appearance when rain stopped play with the Proteas needing 22 off 13 balls for victory . But by the time they came back on the field just ten minutes later , the scoreboard showed they needed an impossible 22 off one ball under the rules governing rain-affected matches at the time . Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 1999 , Edgbaston : South Africa 213 ( J Kallis 53 ; S Warne 4-29 ) v Australia 213 ( M Bevan 65 , S Waugh 56 ; S Pollock 5-36 ) Shaun Pollock bowled impressively as South Africa , despite fifties from Michael Bevan and Stephen Waugh , held Australia to 213 . But with leg-spin great Shane Warne taking four wickets of his own , Australia stayed in the match. But it seemed Lance Klusener was set to win it off his own bat , despite having just last man Allan Donald for company . With four balls left , they needed just one to win but as Klusener set off for a single off a mishit , Donald stayed in his ground , dropped his bat and a relay involving Mark Waugh and Damien Fleming saw the bowler underarm the ball to wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist to complete a run-out . The match was tied but eventual champions Australia went into the final on superior net run-rate .

Faf du Plessis was unable to add to his score of 82 but , with AB de Villiers largely a spectator , David Miller thrashed 49 off just 18 balls as South Africa scored 65 runs in their last five overs . That left New Zealand chasing a revised victory target of 298 in 43 overs. Black Caps skipper Brendon McCullum blazed his way to a typically quick 59 at the top of the order but New Zealand were in trouble at 149 for four . But a stand of 103 between Corey Anderson and Grant Elliott swung the match back New Zealand 's way before South Africa fought back and , with two balls left , the Black Caps needed five to win . However , South Africa-born Elliott capped a superb innings by smashing fast bowler Dale Steyn for six off the penultimate delivery .
