WIPA president Wavell Hinds says agreement " not perfect " , but brings stability to the system . October 7 West Indies players threaten to sit out the first ODI against India and claim that Hinds " hoodwinked " them while signing the MoU . October 8 West Indies play the first ODI , but the captain Bravo asks Hinds and other WIPA officials with conflict of interests , to tender their resignation immediately . October 11 Bravo writes to WICB president Dave Cameron seeking an " urgent intervention " over payment issues between the board , the players , and WIPA . October 15 The growing impasse between the players and WIPA intensifies , with the players and WIPA exchanging emails. Hinds denies all claims made against him and says senior West Indies players had expressed " 100 % support " towards a resolution. Bravo denies any such a resolution was passed . October 16 WICB says it will " engage " only with the WIPA , and not the players , to resolve the issue . October 17 West Indies play the fourth ODI against India in Dharamsala , but news breaks during the game that the rest of the tour has been abandoned . The West Indies tour to India has come to an abrupt end , with the BCCI saying it had been called off by the WICB and announcing a replacement tour. The WICB initially released a statement saying it had not called off the tour , but following a meeting after the fourth ODI in Dharamsala , it clarified that it was " left no option " by the West Indies players . The developments followed a protracted payment structure dispute between the players , the WICB and West Indies Players ' Association . At the end of the game , the official broadcaster Star Sports displayed India as the winners of the ODI series by a 2-1 margin , though no trophy was given to MS Dhoni at the presentation ceremony . Following news of West Indies ' pullout emerged mid-way through the first innings , the BCCI said it was " shocked and disappointed " that the decision to abandon the tour had been " taken by the WICB " , and that India would now play five ODIs against Sri Lanka between November 1 and 15 , after Sri Lanka Cricket accepted the invitation to fill the void . " They have withdrawn their team and this [ development ] has come abruptly. We received an email from Richie Richardson , the West Indies team manager , only this [ Friday ] morning , " BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel told ESPNcricnfo. Patel also said the board was contemplating legal action against the WICB . Shortly after that development , however , the WICB put out a statement saying it had not taken a decision to end the tour. " The West Indies Cricket Board advises , that , contrary to media reports , it has taken no decision to discontinue the ongoing tour to India , " it said. " The WICB will make a further statement following the conclusion of the fourth one-day International which is in progress. " Late in the day , the BCCI issued a second release quoting Richardson 's email and chronicling the events of the last week to support their position : " Despite agreeing to play the fourth ODI in Dharamsala , regrettably , the current West Indies players have decided that they will not participate any further in this tour and wish to return home after this match. In light of this , I suggest that the entire squad travel to Delhi tomorrow and be booked into a hotel there , until international return flights have been booked. On behalf of the entire squad and WICB , I apologise for the inconvenience caused. " West Indies were scheduled to play a fifth ODI , one Twenty20 international and three Tests after the Dharamsala one-dayer . The BCCI 's first release had said , " The WICB 's inability to resolve internal issues with its players and allowing the same to affect an ongoing bilateral series does not reflect well on any of those involved. " They said the withdrawal had " given little thought to the future of the game , the players and the long standing relations between the BCCI and WICB. " " This is a unilateral decision taken by the WICB and its players , in spite of several appeals to the WICB to honour its commitment and complete the series. " The BCCI 's joint secretary Anurag Thakur told PTI the West Indies players were " hell bent not to play " the fourth ODI , and only agreed to take the field upon his insistence . Before the game , Dwayne Bravo , the West Indies ODI captain , had indicated something serious was brewing when he told television commentator Ian Bishop at the toss : " Time to make a decision. " Bravo was accompanied by his West Indies team-mates , who stood beside him . Tony Irish , the executive chairman of international players ' association FICA , is reported to be working with WICB and WIPA to try and resolve the issue. " FICA is dismayed that the tour has been called off , " he said. " It 's not good for cricket and it 's not good for player relations within cricket. " The reason for the dispute was the memorandum of understanding and the combined bargaining agreement signed between WIPA and WICB in September. Bravo , acting as the player representative , had claimed that WIPA president and chief executive Wavell Hinds had kept the players in the dark over the MoU , which he allegedly signed without their consent . On the eve of the first ODI in Kochi , Bravo had warned that if Hinds did not cooperate and respond to the questions raised by the players , a strike or a pullout from the tour could not be ruled out. Though Hinds responded eventually , Bravo continued to insist that he should step down as chief executive and president , and even asked the WICB to not communicate with WIPA till a solution was found. However , WICB president Dave Cameron sent an email to Bravo saying the board would only engage with WIPA , adhering to the MoU signed in September. That development led to the West Indian players taking the extreme step of pulling out of the tour . Former West Indies seamer Michael Holding called the development " ridiculous " and " embarrassing " . " I have never seen anything like this in the past , " Holding told Sky TV. " I can see serious repercussions from this. I think this is a ridiculous decision by the West Indies Cricket Board. They like to hide behind half-truths . " It 's embarrassing for me , as someone who played for West Indies , to see this happening. I was told a director of the WICB did not know about this decision. Let us hope the majority of the board made this decision , otherwise it has been made by very dubious means. " Nagraj Gollapudi is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo Â© ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
