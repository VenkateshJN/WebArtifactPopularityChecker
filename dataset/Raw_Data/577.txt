Last updated on Tuesday , 20 January , 2015 13 : 51 IST Total Shares A file photo of English cricket player Craig Kieswetter . Â© AP An eye injury is likely to ruin England wicketkeeper-batsman Craig Kieswetter 's cricket career. The 27-year-old was injured in July and has been ruled out of the 2015 County season . Kieswetter , who plays for Somerset , damaged his eye socket when a ball smashed through his helmet grill while batting against Northamptonshire. He also broke his nose and injured his cheekbone . After undergoing facial surgery , the England player briefly returned to cricket in September. While playing for Warriors in a domestic T20 match in South Africa , he found out that his vision was still not fine . Somerset 's director of cricket Matthew Maynard said on Monday that Kieswetter will undergo further check-ups with a Belgian specialist this week. " We 're hoping that after he sees the specialist he 'll have a method of getting his eye back to 100 percent , " Maynard told the BBC . " The feedback we get from that will be quite instrumental but potentially it could be career-ending. " Kieswetter , who has played 46 ODIs and has an average of 30.11 , was included in England 's initial 30-man squad for next month 's World Cup but was later replaced by Sam Billings .
