NOR vs GLOUCS - Live IPL 2015 - CSK vs DD , 2nd Match After opting to field first , Delhi Daredevils got off to a good start with Nathan Coulter-Nile scalping the big wickets of Brendon McCullum ( 4 ) and Suresh Raina ( 4 ) , inside the first six overs. He finished with match figures of 4-0-30-3 . IPL 's highest run-getter , Suresh Raina , playing his first game after his wedding , failed to get going as he was cleaned up by Coulter-Nile early . DD played two leg-spinners against CSK , and Imran Tahir and Amit Mishra were successful in curtailing the home team 's run-rate in the middle overs. Tahir picked the wicket of Dwayne Smith and finished with miserly figures of 4-0-27-1 . Fellow leggie Amit Mishra 's too impressed with figures of 4-0-21-1 and was successful in removing Ravindra Jadeja . For CSK , Faf du Plessis made 32 off 24 balls with the help of three boundaries , before he was scalped by JP Duminy. CSK managed to score 150 for 7 . In defence of 150 , CSK 's Ashish Nehra derailed DD 's chase picking three quick wickets and went on to finish with match figures of 4-0-25-3 . A lot was expected from 20-year-old Shreyas Iyer , but the youngster failed to live up to his billing and got out for seven in his first IPL outing . Skipper JP Duminy might have been impressive on his captaincy debut for DD , but he too failed with the bat and got out at a very crucial juncture of the match . But , Yuvraj Singh proved to be the biggest disappointment of the night , as the most expensive player of the IPL 8 could only manage nine runs off six balls , before perishing to a short ball . Albie Morkel , promoted up the order , kept DD in the hunt and took his team agonising close to victory with a valiant 55-ball 73-run unbeaten knock , but DD fell short by just one run .
