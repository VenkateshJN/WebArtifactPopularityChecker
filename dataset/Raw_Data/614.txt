However , yesterday when mid-day visited the museum here at Darling Harbour , we were told that the statue had been moved out a few months ago . " Sachin 's statue has been moved three months ago to our facility in Bangkok. We often do such transfer of statues from one venue to another , " the museum 's supervisor said not wishing to divulge any more details . It 's surprising that the museum would choose to deprive fans of having a closer look at the wax idol of one of cricket 's biggest heroes in a city that 's hosting a World Cup semi-final .
