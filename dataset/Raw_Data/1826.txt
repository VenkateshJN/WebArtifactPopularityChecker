Irani Cup : Karnataka frustrate ROI The author has posted comments on this article Vedam Jaishankar , TNN | Mar 20 , 2015 , 11.27AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 BENGALURU : Not for nothing is it said that champion is what champion does : Karnataka showed the way as they took knocks on the chin and moved on , while Rest of India kept moping about what they perceived to be unfair umpiring decisions . The reigning Irani Cup champions , who also had their fill of poor decisions , rose above the inconvenience , fought tooth and nail and finally eased themselves into the driving seat at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Thursday . Pragyan Ojha , on a comeback trail after being reported for chinks in his bowling action , said the frustration was because some of the umpiring decisions went against them at crucial stages. He had a confident bat-pad catch against Manish Pandey turned down and like some of his teammates , took the decision pretty poorly . Their behaviour took some gloss off what was in essence excellent combative cricket by the home team batsmen. Openers R Samarth ( 81 ; 255m , 159b , 10x4 ) and Mayank Agarwal ( 28 ; 72m , 35b , 4x4 ) set the tone with a patient 54-run stand while debutant Abhishek Reddy ( 31 ; 85m , 54b , 5x4 ) helped Samarth add a further 51 runs . These two small but extremely useful partnerships came at a time when paceman Varun Aaron was bowling really well. But Samarth , who stonewalled the bowling along with Karun Nair ( 80 ; 200m , 123b , 12x4 ) in a fourthwicket partnership of 61 runs , pushed back strongly . Karnataka were still not out of the woods . Brief scores : Karnataka 244 and 3416 in 93 overs ( Ravikumar Samarth 81 , Karun Nair 80 , Manish Pandey 73 batting ; Varun Aaron 285 , Pragyan Ojha 293 ) . RoI 264 .
