West Indies vs United Arab Emirates , 41st Match , Pool B Sun , Mar 15 2015 by CB Staff West Indies almost assured themselves of a position in the quarter-final stage of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 with a thumping six-wicket win over the United Arab Emirates at McLean Park , Napier . That the match even went as far as it eventually did seemed a remote possibility when the lower-ranked side slumped to 46/6 after an inspired opening spell from West Indies captain Jason Holder ( four for 27 ) . Holder was easily the best bowler on view , destroying UAE with pin-point precision and relentless discipline . Opting to bowl first , West Indies started with a bang. Jason Holder ( four for 27 ) struck thrice in quick succession , removing Andri Berrenger , Krishanchandran Karate and Amjad Ali , while Jerome Taylor ( three for 36 ) sent back the experienced pair of Khurram Khan and Shaiman Anwar. Before UAE knew what even hit them , half their side was back in the pavillion. With a pearler of a delivery to start the fourth over , Holder had Andri Berenger caught behind by Denesh Ramdin , and in his next over he removed Krishna Chandran and Amjad Ali , with Chandran making his third duck in the tournament . Krishnachandran was greeted by holder with a superb outswinger , and the right-hander could only edge it behind towards slip - Dwayne Smith taking an easy catch to complete the dismissal. Knowing his side have to take whatever opportunities they can get , the WI captain persisted with himself in the attack. He was rewarded soon after as he had opener Ali out LBW . With the minnows in deep trouble , Holder did not let up on the pressure. He continued with his probing spell and was soon celebrating as he had Swapnil Patil out bowled with a peach of a delivery . UAE had slipped to 46/6 - a position from which they could only partly recover. Holder had served the big blows , and almost assured the Windies of a berth in the last-eight .
