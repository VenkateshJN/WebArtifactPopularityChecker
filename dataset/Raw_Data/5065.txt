Ranji Trophy 2014-15 ( Full Coverage ) Suryakumar Yadav steps down as Mumbai Ranji captain Mumbai , 2015/Jan/26 00 : 05 : 00 Text Size Suryakumar Yadav has quit as Mumbai Ranji skipper in the middle of the 2014-15 season. © BCCL Mumbai 's troubled 2014/15 Ranji Trophy season continues as Suryakumar Yadav has decided to quit as skipper of the team. Results on the field and issues off it may have played their part in Yadav relinquishing the reins . The team currently has 11 points from six games with just one victory. Mumbai started their campaign on a disastrous note when they lost to Jammu and Kashmir for the first time in their Ranji history on December 10 at the Wankhede. They registered an important victory over Uttar Pradesh in Kanpur but since then , they have drawn their next three matches and with just two more rounds to go , their chances of qualifying for the semi-finals remain slim . With results not going their way on the field , the dressing room situation has also deteriorated. The Mumbai Cricket Association ( MCA ) issued a strict warning to both Yadav and paceman Shardul Thakur to improve their behaviour following an on-field spat between the two during Mumbai 's previous Ranji encounter against Madhya Pradesh at the Wankhede at the start of January . The manager of the Mumbai team , Shrikant Tigdi , had presented a report which spoke about Yadav having some disciplinary issues. In a story on the Times of India on January 12 , it was pointed out that while being the Under-25 captain of Mumbai , Yadav got into a fistfight with his teammate Siddesh Lad and later vented his anger by breaking the glass wall in the MCA 's BKC facility. On both occasions he was let-off by Ravi Savant , the vice-president of the MCA . © Cricbuzz ( with inputs from agencies ) More stories from Ranji Trophy 2014-15
