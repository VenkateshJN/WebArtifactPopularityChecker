World Cup 2015 : De Villiers on the edge of suspension The author has posted comments on this article IANS | Feb 23 , 2015 , 09.32PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 MELBOURNE : South African skipper AB de Villiers is one game away from suspension after South Africa were fined for maintaining a slow over-rate during its 130-run loss to India Sunday . The Proteas were ruled to be one over behind by International Cricket Council ( ICC ) match referee Jeff Crowe after time allowances were taken into consideration . While De Villiers was fined 20 percent of his match fee , the other team members were docked 10 percent of the fees , reports the Cricket Australia website . A repeat offence before the final can lead to the skipper 's suspension for the next match of the World Cup . The ICC 's No. 1 ranked one-day international batsman , De Villiers 's absence would be a huge jolt for his side who are in the quest for their maiden World Cup . The captain has made a quiet start to the tourney with scores of 25 and 30 , but has been in red hot form with the bat in the last 12 months , plundering 1,005 ODI runs at 69.58 with three centuries . De Villiers entered the World Cup with a minor over-rate offence he accrued in the first Carlton Mid ODI against Australia in Perth in November , but his offences were wiped clean just like all players .
