Aparajith ton seals semifinals spot The author has posted comments on this article Gaurav Gupta , TNN | Nov 30 , 2014 , 11.19AM IST South Zone 's Baba Aparajith celebrates his century against Central Zone during the Deodhar Trophy at Wankhade in Mumbai. ( PTI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 MUMBAI : Riding on glittering knocks from two youngsters with tremendous potential , and an impressive spell by their skipper , South Zone finally ended their jinx against Central , scoring a crushing 116-run win to storm into the semifinals of the Deodhar Trophy at the Wankhede Stadium on Saturday . After losing to Central Zone six times in a row ( five times in the Deodhar Trophy and recently in the Duleep final ) , South , gained sweet revenge over their nemesis. They will now take on West in the last four clash on Monday . A brilliant hundred by one of the heroes of India 's U-19 World Cup triumph in 2012 , Baba Aparajith ( 113 , 105b , 8x4 , 2x6 ) , and his magnificent 124-run stand for the fourth wicket in 109 balls with Karun Nair ( 74 , 62b , 9x4 ) , helped South Zone post 296 for nine after being put in. The match began after everyone at the ground observed a two-minute silence in memory of Australian opener Phil Hughes , who tragically died on Thursday after being struck by a bouncer at Sydney during a Sheffield Shield game . A listless Central succumbed to Vinay Kumar in the beginning of the chase itself , and never recovered from there , with only Arjit Gupta ( 66 , 49b , 5x4 , 5x6 ) showing some spine. While all the five national selectors present at the ground must have been pleased with Aparajith and Nair 's batting , Kumar 's burst with the ball ( 6-2-8-3 ) , apart from a smartly effected run out , would have reminded them of his case for the ODI Tri-series that follows the Tests in Australia . Aparajith and Nair 's efforts on Saturday promise much from them in the future. The youngsters joined forces after their team had slipped to 88 for three , and quickly took the game away from the opposition. Showing their prowess against spin , both made mincemeat of Central Zone tweakers Piyush Chawla and Kuldeep Yadav , smashing them for 115 runs in 14 overs. Being the skipper , it must have been embarrassing for Chawla to go for 61 off seven overs , while Yadav , who was included in the India squad not too long ago on account of being a 'surprise weapon, ' gave away only seven less in as many overs . Brief scores : South Zone 2969 ( Baba Aparajith 113 , Karun Nair 74 ; Pankaj Singh 545 ) bt Central Zone 180 in 36.3 overs ( Arijit Gupta 66 , Mukul Dagar 47 ; R Vinay Kumar 38 ) Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
