No choice but to drop Watson , says Aussie selector Marsh The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Mar 4 , 2015 , 02.01PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 PERTH ( Australia ) : Australia 's chairman of selectors Rod Marsh said Wednesday that Shane Watson 's poor form with the bat meant they had little choice but to drop the experienced all-rounder . The 33-year-old , who averages 50.89 with the bat in career World Cup matches , was axed from the side to face Afghanistan at the WACA and replaced by fellow all-rounder James Faulkner , returning from a side strain . " ( It ) is a big decision but it 's one we thought we had to make because in Shane 's last 10 one-day games he 's got 220 runs at an average of 22 and unfortunately he 's been getting starts but he has n't been going on with it , " said Marsh . " We had to fit James in and someone had to go. I 'm not saying it was a choice between any players but just happened to be it was Shane 's time to go for this particular match. " However , Marsh said it was far from the end of Watson 's ODI career. " It does n't mean anything going forward except that he 's not in the XI at the moment , " he said. " If things change then there 's no reason he wo n't be back in the XI . " He 's a fine , fine player , he 's averaging 40 in one-day cricket and it was a tough decision. He 's in the 15 still , that 's the thing , and hopefully he 'll find himself back in the team at some stage . " If hard decisions have to be made we have to make them.
