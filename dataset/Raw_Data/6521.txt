County news January 26 , 2015 Northants sign short-term Afridi deal ESPNcricinfo staff shares 18 Shahid Afridi is one the most dangerous hitters in world cricket © AFP One of the biggest names in world cricket will feature in the T20 Blast next season with Northamptonshire signing Pakistan allrounder Shahid Afridi . But the deal , which is still subject to clearance from the Pakistan Cricket Board , highlights the difficulties counties have in attracting big names for the competition. Afridi will only be available for the first six matches . Nevertheless , 34-year-old Afridi , one of the most dangerous hitters in the game and a canny legspinner , is capable of putting Northants in a strong position to qualify from the 14-match group stage . Afridi , a veteran of 77 T20 internationals , last appeared in county cricket in 2012 , the second of his two-year stint with Hampshire , for whom he took 19 wickets at 12.57 . " This is a very exciting signing for us , " head coach David Ripley said. " Shahid is without doubt the most outstanding spin-bowling allrounder in one-day international cricket of the last five years. He is a fierce competitor and undoubted match-winner with bat and ball . " He brings a wealth of experience to the dressing room with over 230 Twenty20 games as well as captaining his Country. " Northants will be looking for a healthier campaign next season after a 2014 that saw them meekly surrender their famously-won title , winningly only four of their 14 group matches . Afridi added : " I am looking forward to playing in the T20 Blast. I have always enjoyed playing in England , where I have always found the crowds good natured and knowledgeable . " I am very happy to be joining a good Northants squad in the search for Twenty20 success. " © ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
