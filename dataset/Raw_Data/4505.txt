Scorecard | Points Table Chasing a competitive 289 to win , New Zealand rode on a 131-run third-wicket partnership between Guptill ( 105 ) and Ross Taylor ( 56 ) to stay atop pool A with 12 points , followed by Sri Lanka ( 8 ) , Australia ( 7 ) and Bangladesh ( 7 ) . Bangladesh , who had reached the quarterfinals for the first time after beating England last Monday , are now most likely to take on defending champions India in the last eight stage after finishing fourth .

If the minnows can stun the four-time champions by a big margin , the position of the teams may change . Earlier , Mahmudullah cracked his second successive century -- a career-best unbeaten 128 -- to power Bangladesh to a competitive 288 for seven . Defending the total , Bangladesh started off well dismissing dangerous opener and host captain Brendon McCullum ( 8 ) and first down batsman Kane Williamson ( 1 ) cheaply to reduce the Kiwis to 33/2 inside five overs . But Guptill and Taylor added 131 runs to not only script a recovery but also lay the foundation for a successful chase . Guptill 's 100-ball innings was laced with 11 hits to the fence and two sixes , while Taylor blasted five boundaries in his 97-ball stay at Seddon park . However after Guptill was holed out by Rubel Hossain off Shakib Al Hasan 's bowling in the 31st over at 164/3 , New Zealand suffered a mini-collapse to give Bangladesh a faint hope of a turnaround . Nasir Hossain dismissed Taylor , while Rubel sent back Grant Elliott ( 39 ) in quick succession and then Shakib , who picked up four wickets , got rid off Luke Ronchi to further reduce the hosts to 247/6 in 44.4 overs . However , No. 8 batsman Daniel vettori ( 16 ) smashed a six and a four in his 10-ball innings to ensure that New Zealand romp home , reaching 290/7 with seven balls to spare . Earlier , Bangladesh rode on a brilliant innings by Mahmudullah , who starred in two crucial partnerships with Soumya Sarkar ( 51 ) and Sabbir Rahman ( 40 ) for the third and sixth wicket respectively after Kiwi skipper Brendon McCullum won the toss and elected to field . Mahmudullah , who had become the first Bangladesh batsman to score a World Cup century during his 103-run innings against England on Monday , shared 90 runs with Soumya before adding another 78 with Sabbir on Friday . The 29-year-old cracked 12 boundaries and three sixes in his 123-ball unconquered innings at Seddon Park. Soumya had seven boundaries to show in his 58-ball stay , while Shabbir blasted five fours and two sixes in his 23-ball innings . For New Zealand , Corey Anderson ( 2-43 ) , Trent Boult ( 2-56 ) and Grant Elliott ( 2-27 ) scalped two wickets each , while Daniel vettori claimed one . Bangladesh lost both their openers inside 10 overs with the score reading 27 for two but Mahmudullah and Soumya stemmed the rot with a 90 run partnership as the Asian nations crossed the 100-mark . Soumya threw his wicket just after amassing his fifty when he caught by Anderson at long-on off Vettori . Shakib Al Hasan ( 23 ) and Mahmudullah then brought up the 150 before Anderson got rid of the Bangladeshi allrounder as they slipped 151-4 in 34 overs . Mushfiqur Rahim ( 15 ) too had a brief stay in the middle and after he was dismissed by Anderson it was Sabbir , who played the perfect cameo to raise the tempo after the 40th over . Sabbir and Mahmudullah ensured Bangladesh accumulated 108 runs in the last 10 overs as they took the attack to the opposition , adding 78 off 48 balls , to take their team across the 250-mark .
