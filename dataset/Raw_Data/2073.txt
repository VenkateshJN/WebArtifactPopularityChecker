READ MORE Mumbai Cricket Association | IPL 7 | Cricket Club of India | BCCI RELATED MUMBAI : Smarting over the IPL Governing Council 's move to shift the final from Mumbai to Bangalore , the Mumbai Cricket Association ( MCA ) has dashed off a letter to the Cricket Club of India questioning them how they can host the May 28 Eliminator without obtaining an NOC from MCA , which is cricket 's governing body in the city . The MCA has also written to the BCCI , apparently reminding them that as per the Board 's constitution , it 's the state association 's prerogative to allot matches to centres that fall in its jurisdiction . In its letter to the CCI , MCA has asked how it plans to accommodate the former players , clubs , sub-committee members and its many volunteers when they have handed the entire stadium to the BCCI barring thousand plus tickets which have been reserved for their members. Sevanti Parekh , the chairman of the CCI , did confirm that he had received the letter but said the MCA should instead sort out its issues with the BCCI . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Mumbai Cricket Association,IPL 7,Cricket Club of India,BCCI Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
