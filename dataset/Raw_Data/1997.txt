( TOI Photo ) RELATED KOLKATA : Kolkata Knight Riders needed a win to qualify for the playoffs and they achieved that in style , recording their sixth win on the trot by beating Royal Challengers Bangalore by 30 runs at the Eden Gardens on Thursday . The defeat knocked RCB out of IPL 7 . RCB skipper Virat Kohli , by opting to field first after winning the toss , clearly wanted to throw a different challenge to the Knight Riders , who have revelled in chasing targets down targets . It did n't work as KKR not only posted 195/4 , their highest score in IPL 7 , but also defended it smartly . It called for a superlative effort from RCB big-hitters to overhaul the target , but they flattered to deceive . KKR 's mystery spinner Sunil Narine proved to be their nemesis , picking up four wickets , including that of Kohli , Yuvraj Singh and AB de Villiers , for just 20 runs . KKR were , once again , led admirably by Gautam Gambhir. The Windies spinner sealed the match in KKR 's favour by dismissing Yuvraj and De Villiers in the 17th over . Narine , who took his wickets tally to 20 this season , got back the purple cap. Earlier , Robin Uthappa put Gambhir 's early dismissal behind him and continued to flaunt his red-hot form . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Virat Kohli,Royal Challengers Bangalore,Robin Uthappa,Kolkata Knight Riders,Gautam Gambhir Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
