Loading comments Alexei on April 3 , 2015 , 20 : 13 GMT WI wo n't lose much players if any to the IPL though. Gayle 's back is without a doubt not up to Test cricket even if his mind was in the first place. Narine has n't REALLY returned to competitive cricket , he 's only just passed that ICC test but would definitely be in the Test squad. No one else in the current squad was picked up by IPL franchises so WI should virtually be at full strength.. Just one player would be missing Nympholept on April 2 , 2015 , 10 : 12 GMT Why do n't sensible people like Ian Chapel and Geoffrey Boycott get positions in ICC ? on April 2 , 2015 , 5 : 44 GMT In order to bring back balance b/w bat & ball in ODI , just like batting power play bowling team should be allowed field relaxation play of 5 overs anytime during the match in which they be allowed to have upto 5 fielders out . People do n't wan na see substandard cricket. Thankfully new rules have kicked out part timers. Now is the time to get rid of substandard edged boundaries by allowing 1 extra deep fielder anywhere in 30 degree arc right behind the keeper throughout the match . Bat size argument is rubbish bcz WI batsmen esp Richards have used big bats to slaughter worldwide bowlers & so should modern batsmen have the option to do . Popular Videos
