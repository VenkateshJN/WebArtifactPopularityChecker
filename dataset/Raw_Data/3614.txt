Faulkner 's injury is bad news for the Aussies as the opening match of the World Cup against England is just a fortnight away ( February 14 ) . The 24-year-old all-rounder has been a key player in the Australian ODI side in recent years . The gravity of Faulkner 's injury was n't lost on fellow all-rounder Glenn Maxwell .

" The thought of being ruled out so late with an injury , even if it 's nothing , just the thought of that would hurt a lot of people. I know a few of us out there were hurting for him when he went off. He 's a super cricketer and he 's a vital cog in this Australian outfit. We can hope it is nothing , that he 's being soft and gets back and trains hard with us next week , " Maxwell said .
