Full Coverage : ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 India 's 413 for five against Bermuda in the 2007 edition remains the highest score . The two batsmen put up an impressive 247-run partnership for the second wicket as Amla hit 16 fours and four sixes , while du Plessis struck 10 boundaries and a six . Later David Miller and Rilee Rossouw went hammer and tongs as South Africa scored 230 in the last 20 overs , leaving the Irish bowlers bruised and battered. The last 8.3 overs fetched 110 runs . During their belligerent unbroken partnership , Rossouw found the fence six times and cleared it thrice in his 30-ball 61 , while Miller hit four boundaries and two sixes in his 23-ball 46 . Andy Balbirnie ( 58 ) and Kevin O'Brien ( 48 ) were the only Ireland batsmen who resisted the fierce Proteas pace attack with their fighting knocks while others crumbled as the team was bowled out for 210 . Hyle Abbott gave away only 21 runs in his eight overs and took four wickets while Dale Steyn ( 2/39 ) dismissed two batsmen as Ireland were shot out in 45 overs . In South Africa 's innings , skipper AB de Villiers , who had smashed the world record for the fastest 150 in their previous game against the West Indies , missed out but still made 24 off just nine balls with two sixes and a four. Against the Caribbeans last week , South Africa had amassed 408 for five . Spinner Andy McBrine , who was called for this match , was the most successful bowler for Ireland , returning figures of two for 63 . The Irish paid the price for dropping both Amla and du Plessis earlier in the innings , allowing the batsmen to set themselves up for a severe punishment . The Proteas not only found the fence with consummate ease but also ran the singles and twos regularly , adding to Ireland 's misery . South Africa have won all three of the previous ODIs against Ireland , two of which have come at World Cups -- 2007 and 2011 .
