Shammi Silva , a member of Sri Lanka Cricket ( SLC ) executive committee , in his letter dated February 20 and addressed to Dissanayake , stated that an Indian player was involved in match-fixing during the tournament held in Dambulla. India , Sri Lanka , Pakistan and Bangladesh were the participating nations . According to the letter , Silva , on February 11 , had written to SLC chair Jayantha Dharmadasa about the matter . " Considering the importance of the matter , I kindly request you to appoint a special committee to investigate the above matter as early as possible. It is very essential to hold an inquiry by the Ministry of Sports in order to avoid unnecessary interference by vested interest personalities , Silva wrote in his letter to Dissanayake . Silva 's letter has come after reports late last year that the SLC hierarchy had dodged the Mudgal probe panel investigating Indian cricket 's corruption scandals . It was said the Mudgal panel was probing an incident about a leading Indian batsman spending a night with a woman , who had suspected bookie links , at a Dambulla hotel room during the tournament .
