World Cup 2015 : Clarke to return against Bangladesh , says Lehmann The author has posted comments on this article Reuters | Feb 18 , 2015 , 07.19PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 Australia captain Michael Clarke will return to the side for Saturday 's World Cup match against Bangladesh after recovering from hamstring surgery , coach Darren Lehmann said on Wednesday . Clarke 's race to be fit has been something of a soap opera in Australia and he played his first match for the team in two months last week in a warm-up against United Arab Emirates . Clarke hit 64 against UAE but sat out the team 's 111-run romp over England in their tournament opener . " Yeah , he 's playing mate , " Lehmann told reporters in Brisbane . Clarke , who is likely to replace stand-in skipper George Bailey , bowled and batted in the nets on Wednesday and was satisfied with the progress he has made . " We had a good conversation ( with selectors ) last week and thought it was in the team 's best interests to not play against England and give me another week , " he said . " At this stage I think the selectors are very happy. " Heavy showers have been forecast for the weekend and the two cyclones expected might push Clarke 's return back to Australia 's Feb. 28 match against co-hosts New Zealand in Auckland .
