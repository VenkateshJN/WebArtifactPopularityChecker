World Cup 2015 : New Zealand need to be desperate on the field , says McCullum The author has posted comments on this article IANS | Mar 13 , 2015 , 06.58PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 HAMILTON : Skipper Brendon McCullum on Friday said that New Zealand need to be desperate on the field as they enter the business-end of the cricket World Cup . " I cut my hands a couple of times ( diving ) but we have to be desperate in the field. It is an attitude we need to bring to the table. If we are serious about going deep , we got to keep it up , " said McCullum . New Zealand defeated Bangladesh in a Pool A encounter at Seddon Park here on Friday by three wickets to remain unbeaten in the tournament. McCullum himself pulled off some incredible diving stops to restrict the opposition to 288/7 in 50 overs at the small ground . The 33-year-old said his fielders were not as attentive as he would like them to be . " Sometimes you are not always going to be on. Our awareness and our attention in the field could have been improved. A little bit untidy in all three facets of the game , " he said . The captain further added that New Zealand were not too concerned about whom they would face in the knockouts but would like to deliver their best . " It does n't bother us who we play next. We just need to reach the levels we are capable off , just be on song , and then make sure we turn up and deliver , come the quarterfinal , " he concluded . New Zealand will play Ireland , West Indies or Pakistan in the quarterfinal following which team finishes fourth in Pool A. The match will be held at Westpac Stadium in Wellington on March 21 .
