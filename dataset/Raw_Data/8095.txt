19 March 201517 : 25 By Dileep Premachandran , Melbourne Rohit stars as India seals semi-final berth Centurion combines with Raina to post 302 before Umesh , Shami run through Bangladesh to earn 109-run win Share this article : Rohit Sharma ’ s 137 , off just 126 balls , was the centerpiece of India ’ s 302 for 6 . A masterful hundred , a feisty half-century , exceptional fast bowling , two fabulous catches – the 51,552 who came to the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Thursday ( March 19 ) were treated to all of this as India beat Bangladesh by 109 runs in the second quarter-final of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 . Rohit Sharma ’ s 126-ball 137 and his 122-run partnership in just 95 balls with Suresh Raina ( 65 off 57 balls ) transformed the match after Bangladesh had restricted India to 99 for 2 in the first 25 overs. With luck on their side , India rattled off 147 from the final 15 , and Bangladesh ’ s failure to stitch together significant partnerships meant it fell behind . Rohit had started the match with a glorious square drive off Mashrafe Mortaza , but runs were hard to come by once Nasir Hossain was called on to bowl his off-spin in the sixth over. Shikhar Dhawan was relatively subdued on his way to 30 from 50 balls , and was the first to go , stumped off Shakib Al Hasan ’ s bowling after a 75-run stand ( 99 balls ) . Virat Kohli made just three before a loose stroke at Rubel Hossain saw the edge neatly taken by Mushfiqur Rahim. Rubel ’ s celebrations were prolonged and unrestrained , and his first spell excellent – 6-0-14-1. When Ajinkya Rahane miscued Taskin Ahmed to cover , India was 115 for 3 with just 22 overs remaining . # IND march on ! How far will they go at # cwc15 ? pic.twitter.com/4OIwmGVXaE — ICC ( @ ICC ) March 19 , 2015 Raina and Rohit then started to accelerate. In the Power Play that followed , India took 50 runs. Rohit was handed a reprieve on 90 , and eased to his hundred off 108 balls , having taken 70 for his half-century , while Raina needed just 46 balls for his 50 . Raina eventually fell to a mistimed heave , but Rohit went on to smite 14 fours and three sixes in an innings that ensured India would post a huge total. Ravindra Jadeja ’ s 23 off ten balls at the end nudged the scoreboard past 300 . To overhaul that , Bangladesh needed a big innings of its own. But Tamim Iqbal , who struck three fours off Mohammed Shami , was guilty of going for one stroke too many. Umesh Yadav got one to shape away , and Dhoni gathered the edge just in front of him. Next ball , Soumya Sarkar played one behind point and was guilty of ball-watching even as Imrul Kayes hared down the pitch. Jadeja ’ s throw to Umesh found him short of his ground . Sarkar and Mahmudullah added 40 , but at a pace that didn ’ t worry India. Shami , taken for 18 in his first two overs , then returned to snaffle both. Dhawan took a superb catch on the rope at fine leg to send back Mahmudullah , centurion against England and New Zealand , flicking the ball up , stepping outside the rope and then coming back in to gather . Sarkar ’ s 29 ended when he opened the face and guided one to Dhoni ’ s left. The Indian captain made good ground to take a stunning catch. Shakib looked off colour and eventually cut Jadeja to point , and when Mushfiqur ’ s heave at Umesh only went as far as Dhoni , the game was as good as done . Nasir Hossain and Sabbir Rahman added 50 to delay the inevitable , but the end was swift , as Umesh – pacy , hostile and accurate – finished with 4 for 31. Australia or Pakistan , who play on Friday in Adelaide , awaits India in the semi-final .
