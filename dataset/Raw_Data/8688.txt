The Essentials For the love of attack Shashi Tharoor , the former United Nations under-secretary-general , Indian member of Parliament , and writer , on his favourite cricketers and more January 2015 Tweet What is the best day of cricket you have watched live ? My very first. Budhi Kunderan batting against England , Brabourne Stadium , 1963-64 , tossing his bat up in the air when he got caught , catching it as he ran into the pavilion. I was hooked . Who is the one player you would pay to watch ? Sehwag. He could transform a game , like a swashbuckling hero dispelling a dozen attackers with his rapier. Kapil Dev before him commanded the ground . Who would captain your all-time XI ? Mike Brearley. The only cricketer who was a better captain than he was a player . What 's the best place to watch cricket ? I 've been privileged to sit behind the bowler 's arm at Eden Gardens , the Feroz Shah Kotla , the Brabourne Stadium ( but not the Wankhede ) , the Nehru Stadium in Kochi , The Oval in London , Lord 's , the Wanderers , the MCG , the old Adelaide Oval , and a lovely ground in Paarl in South Africa. If I had to pick one , it would probably be Eden Gardens , where I saw many matches as a teenager and often got into the press box ! As a kid , what was your speciality when you played cricket ? I was an allrounder who did everything with great style and little ability. I wanted to play cricket very badly , and that 's what I did - I played cricket very badly . What can politicians learn from cricket and cricketers ? The core lesson of pursuing individual excellence within the framework of a team game , and always putting your own talents at the service of the team 's success . Â© ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
