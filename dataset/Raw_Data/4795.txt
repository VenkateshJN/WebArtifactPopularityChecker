Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 It was Sangakkara 's 24th century in 402 one-day internationals and Thirimanne said the vastly experienced 37-year-old was a steadying influence on the team . Asked where Sangakkara , who is playing in his final World Cup , ranked in the pantheon of greats , Thirimanne said he was right at the top . " At the current moment I think he 's number one , " he said. " I mean , he is batting really well . " Not only is he rotating the strike , but hitting the boundaries as well. So it is very helpful for the team. " Thirimanne himself made an unbeaten 139 against England and said he was thrilled to carry his bat after only being promoted to open in the lead-up to the tournament . He also has two half centuries at the tournament , while Sri Lanka 's potent batting line up includes another two World Cup centurions in Tillakaratne Dilshan and Mahela Jayawardene . But Thirimanne said Sri Lanka , finalists at the last tow World Cups , could not rely on batting alone and had to improve other aspects of their game . " Our fielding was n't good... in this tournament you ca n't do it only batting and survive . " You have to field , you have to bowl really well. So we have to improve on that side.
