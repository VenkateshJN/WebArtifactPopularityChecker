He has a fine array of skills that make him in equal measure a match-saver and a match-winner . That he is equally adept at playing Tests , ODIs and T20s and still have an immense impact on the game tells volumes about his ability. de Villiers also is the quintessential team man , taking up captaincy duties , keeping duties whenever the team needs. He is also an electric fielder , known for taking spell-binding catches and effecting nigh-impossible run outs and saves. All this makes him , arguably , the best player of his generation. That is something even his contemporaries agree on . " He is the best batsman in the world by far and proves it again and again , " said Virat Kohli . " He is the most valuable player on the planet , " chimed in Adam Gilchrist . But the biggest compliment for him came from his South Africa team-mate , IPL opponent and the world 's most feared fast bowler - Dale Steyn . " There are only two games I dread every year. Those are the matches when I come up against AB de Villiers , " Â© Cricbuzz
