World Cup : Pakistan thrash UAE , warm up for SA clash The author has posted comments on this article Dwaipayan Datta , TNN | Mar 5 , 2015 , 11.19AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 NAPIER : There 's nothing like a good practice session in the middle and Pakistan got just that at the McLean Park before their big game against South Africa on Saturday . United Arab Emirates , like some of the other minnows , are here to fill up the numbers and they never came close to challenging a struggling Pakistan on a gloomy day . UAE coach Aaqib Javed had claimed a couple of days back that they would test the Pakistani batting. But all they did was to give the top-order some vital batting practice as they set up the 129-run win . Ahmed Shehzad ( 93 off 105 balls ) and Haris Sohail ( 70 off 83 balls ) found some form during the course of their 160-run second-wicket partnership. Shehzad , though , was dropped twice early on . The UAE bowling had nothing in it which could put the Pakistan bat ting in any trouble. Sohail and Shehzad kept finding the gaps and got the singles to maintain a steady run-rate after Nasir Jamshed departed early. There was the occasional boundary and Pakistan always looked good for a big score . The UAE bowling lacked the pace to push the batsmen on the back-foot. They lacked bowlers who could move the white ball around in the overcast conditions . The pitch , though , played a tad slow and Sohail , who was looking good for a century , mistimed one and gave a catch to mid-on. Shehzad , too , missed out on a ton when he failed to beat a throw coming in from the deep , trying to go for an improbable second . But there was no crisis even after the two were dismissed in quick succession . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
