Comments have now been closed for this article January 2 , 2015 , 6 : 58 GMT By wapuser I absolutely agree. Australia have been freely using sledging as a tactic in the 'gentleman 's game'. When opposition teams ' players adopt the same strategy , they ca n't stomach it ! Speaks volumes of their tolerance levels. I do n't subscribe to sledging as a strategy , per se December 30 , 2014 , 15 : 54 GMT By apshah63 Yes. Kohli has earned the right to give some back to the Aussies. That is the only language they understand. They have started it. They must receive it back. However , other players of our team should not follow Kohli. They should let their bat/ ball do the talking . December 30 , 2014 , 15 : 33 GMT By He Bloody right ! They already scared ! Di n't you see how they played for the Draw ? They could have declared last evening or within the first hours play ! They now know this Indian Team would go for it ! Win or lose ! You are witnessing the 'Dawn of a New Age for Indian Cricket ! ' December 30 , 2014 , 14 : 13 GMT By jingopack It is OK with virat.... He is answering with bat also.... But what about rohit Sharma...ishant Sharma and dhawan....both these batsman have n't scored any meaningful runs so far and ishant takes 2wickets per test match for 200 runs...looks foolish when they do so December 30 , 2014 , 12 : 05 GMT By Vidyasagar55 Keep it simple dude. Let an individual 's skill do the talking. Let bowler 's bowling , batter 's batting , fielder 's fielding etc do the talking. Where is the need for sledging ? Being abusive and violent is a sign of a timid weak soul that lacks inner strength . December 30 , 2014 , 11 : 44 GMT By wapuser The Australian team love to give it but ca n't always take it. Having said that Kohli does sometimes bring it upon himself as he gets involved with things that do n't always concern him . December 30 , 2014 , 11 : 18 GMT By Of course. They should be sledged back. What 's good for the goose is good for the gander. But Kohli talks with his bat while Johnson is useless. He gets mostly tail-enders wickets.International Cricketer of the Year , my foot ! March 14 , 2015 , 20 : 18 GMT By wapuser no it is very unfortunate that professionals act in such ways December 30 , 2014 , 16 : 01 GMT By thaikkathameed Virat Kohli showing his immaturity. He is the Indian version of Javed Miandad . December 30 , 2014 , 9 : 09 GMT By xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx I like the way that Virat plays the game - hard , competitive , plays to win and gives 100 % . Like an Aussie. But when he gives a lot of " lip " himself he can not expect to get away with whingeing about receiving it back and expect to be taken seriously . Related Links
