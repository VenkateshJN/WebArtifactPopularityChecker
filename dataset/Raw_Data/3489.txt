( PTI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 HYDERABAD : Perth Scorchers ' bid to stop the Kolkata Knight Riders juggernaut failed to bear fruit as the 'hosts ' extended their winning streak to 12 with a close three-wicket win in their Group A match of the CLT20 on Wednesday . Electing to bat after skipper Adam Voges won the toss , Perth Scorchers were off to a bright start with Voges and Craig Simmons ( 39 ; 30b , 6x4 , 1x6 ) adding 68 for the first wicket , the best opening partnership posted by any side against the Knight Riders in 19 T20 matches this year . But once chinaman Kuldeep Yadav got rid of Simmons , KKR spun their way back into the game. Kuldeep and then Sunil Narine had the Scorchers on a tight leash and restricted them to 151 for seven despite Voges scoring an unbeaten 52ball 71 ( 8x4 , 1x6 ) . The Scorchers , however , seemed determined to make a fight of the game as their new ball pair of Jason Behrendorff and Joel Paris struck two quick blows . Paris had skipper Gautam Gambhir ( 2 ) caught by Ashton Turner and then Behrendorff had Jacques Kallis ( 6 ) caught by Simmons to reduce the Knight Riders to 13 for two . Robin Uthappa ( 23 ; 18b , 4x4 ) and then Manish Pandey ( 24 ; 23b , 3x4 ) tried to revive the innings but the Scorchers pacers were in no mood to relent . Ryan ten Doeschate too perished while trying to force the pace . At 87 for five , the Knight Riders were in trouble but Suryakumar Yadav had other ideas .
