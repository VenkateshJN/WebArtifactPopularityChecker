West Indies have been woeful in overseas Tests against the top teams in the last 14 years. Their only win has come in South Africa , where they return for a three-Test series shares 16 Kemar Roach has a career bowling average of 25.98 , but he needs to lift his game when playing overseas Â© WICB Over the next three weeks , West Indies will make another attempt to correct what has been a woeful overseas record over the last decade and more , when they play three Tests against the top-ranked team in Test cricket. As if playing the best team in their home conditions was n't tough enough , West Indies have been further hampered by the loss of two key batsmen : Chris Gayle has n't recovered from a back injury , while Darren Bravo has pulled out due to personal reasons. The only positive is a return to the country where they last won an overseas Test outside of Zimbabwe and Bangladesh : on their tour here in 2007-08 , they won by 128 runs in Port Elizabeth before losing the next two Tests to lose the series 2-1 . ( Port Elizabeth is the venue for the second Test this time. ) That win in the Boxing Day Test in 2007 is , in fact , West Indies only Test win outside Zimbabwe and Bangladesh in the last 14 years , which illustrates just how badly West Indies cricket has slipped. In the 14 previous years before November 2000 ( November 1986 to October 2000 ) , West Indies had a 22-26 win-loss record in 64 Tests in these countries. They won at least one match in every country where they played two or more Tests except , ironically , South Africa , where they lost five out of five in 1998-99. In other countries , though , they were extremely competitive : their win-loss record was 7-5 in Australia , 9-7 in England , 2-2 in India , 2-3 in New Zealand , and 2-4 in Pakistan . More recently , though , the only countries they 've toured well are Zimbabwe and Bangladesh : in ten Tests there they have a 7-0. On other tours , they 've mostly been awful : 0-10 in Australia , 0-11 in England , 0-6 in India , 0-4 in Pakistan and New Zealand , 0-5 in Sri Lanka , and 1-5 in South Africa. All of that adds up to a dismal 1-45 win-loss in these countries . A comparison of batting and bowling averages in these countries reveals that bowling has been the bigger problem , with the team conceding almost 46 runs per wicket , compared to a bowling average of less than 35 at home. The batting has suffered too , though not as much , dropping from 32.66 at home to 27.19 in these countries. A comparison between the two periods also shows that bowling has been the bigger problem for them in the last 14 years . West Indies ' Test record since Nov 2000
