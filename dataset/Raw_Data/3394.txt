Bangladesh vs England match - a remake of Lagaan ? The author has posted comments on this article Pratyush Patra , TNN | Mar 11 , 2015 , 12.08PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 On Monday , Bangladesh , the team in the green jersey , did n't only have the rub of the green - they played some disciplined cricket too to knock England out of the tournament . Like any underdog movie , the match was won in the dying minutes of the game. Bangladesh 's 15-run win was applauded by the cricket-lovers as tweets kept pouring in , appreciating the Bangla Tigers. Many in India poked fun at England for disparate reasons like ruling us for 200 years and inventing cricket . Bangladesh made it to the quarterfinals , joining the other three test playing countries of the Indian subcontinent , and will most likely face defending champions India in the next round. India , on the other hand , would not only be eyeing an easy passage to the semi-finals but also avenge the humiliation that we received at the hands of our neighbours in 2007 World Cup. India had lost to both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the group stage , making an early exit from the tournament. While we defeated Sri Lanka in the 2011 finals , it is Bangladesh 's fate that our men in blue will hope to seal this time around . Twitter buzz after the England vs Bangladesh match RIP England , more ashes to be made. Big takeaway for the day... it 's not just enough to invent , you need to be mastering it. # BANvsENG - @ vsrao20 One tiger is too much for three lions ! # BAN # BANvsENG - @ 00Rayhan Today 's match between # BANvsENG was a remake of Lagaan. - @ HNakvi Congrats # Bangladesh ! !
