" Dhammika Prasad was hit on the outside of the left hand when attempting a return catch while bowling today , " a Sri Lanka Cricket statement said. " The X-ray showed a fracture of the fifth metacarpal bone. The fracture has been realigned and put in a cast. Dhammika will not be available for the upcoming World Cup. " Sri Lanka were hoping to field a strong bowling unit in the quadrennial event in which they finished runners-up four years ago , but Prasad 's injury casts a doubt on the squad which is already hoping for spearhead Lasith Malinga 's return to full fitness . Sri Lanka will now have to name a replacement for Prasad who will have to be approved by the ICC , but the favourite appears to be Shaminda Eranga , who was originally left out of the 15-member squad . © Cricbuzz ( with inputs from agencies ) Tags
