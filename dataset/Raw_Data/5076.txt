Australia tri-series 2014-15 ( Full Coverage ) WC warm-ups to serve as fitness test for Rohit 2015/Jan/27 11 : 12 : 00 Text Size Rohit Sharma wo n't play any further part in the Australia tri-series. © BCCI For Rohit Sharma , the ongoing tri-series in Australia is as good as over. The Indian opener , who hit 138 in India 's tri-series opener against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , is not going to be risked into playing the final round-robin match against England on Friday as he is yet to fully recover from the hamstring injury he suffered in that game on January 16. Rohit 's fitness will in fact be tested in the World Cup practice matches against Australia and Afghanistan next month . Even if India manage to reach the final after beating England , Rohit will be kept out of the summit clash on February 1. " Chances of Rohit playing in the tri-series even if India reaches the final is next to nil. He is recovering but the Indian team management does not want to risk a key player with the World Cup starting in less than three weeks , " a source was quoted as saying by PTI on Tuesday . " The physio said after having a look at the MRI reports that Rohit needed a week 's rest and after that could start training. With Shikhar Dhawan completely out of form , they do not want to risk Rohit in this tournament as they have a World Cup to play. The February 8 and 10 warm-up games against Australia and Afghanistan will serve as Rohit 's match-fitness test , " he said . Ishant Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja , who were previously battling injury concerns , were included in the playing XI for the side 's third game of the series against Australia on Monday , but could n't play a part because the match was washed out after just 19 overs of play after India were put in to bat at the Sydney Cricket Ground . © Cricbuzz ( with inputs from agencies ) More stories from Australia tri-series 2014-15
