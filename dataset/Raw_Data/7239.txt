Other teams have matched South Africa 's top order in terms of averages and run rates in ODIs in the last two years , but none has scored hundreds at the rate that South African batsmen have shares 1 Hashim Amla has scored nine hundreds in 44 ODI innings since the start of 2013 , an average of a century every 4.89 innings Â© Associated Press In the recently concluded five-ODI series against West Indies , South Africa 's batsmen slammed six hundreds : two each by Hashim Amla and Rilee Rossouw , and one by AB de Villiers and David Miller. Each of those innings exceeded 125 , and only one ended with a sub-100 strike rate : Miller 's 130 in Port Elizabeth came in 133 balls , and was the slowest of those six innings . It 's rare that a team scores so many hundreds in an ODI series. Sri Lanka 's seven in the 2011 World Cup is the highest in any series or tournament , but in a bilateral series , six centuries have been achieved on only four other occasions : by South Africa , against Zimbabwe in 2010 , by India against Australia in 2013-14 , by Sri Lanka against England in 2006 , and by Pakistan against India in 1982-83. In none of these four instances , though , were each of the hundreds in excess of 125 , which makes South Africa 's recent effort the first instance of six scores of 125 or more by a team in an ODI series , bilateral or otherwise . In recent times , there 's been a solidity and flair to South Africa 's batting that makes them arguably the most feared batting line-up going into the 2015 World Cup. Amla and de Villiers have been stunningly consistent and yet explosive , while the others in the top order have batted well around them. Quinton de Kock has shone in the short period that he has played one-day internationals , Miller has handled the pressures of batting at No. 6 pretty well , while Faf du Plessis and JP Duminy have shown they are adept at this format too. In the last two years , all six of these players have averaged more than 35 in ODIs , at a strike rate of more than 80. Rossouw has been the exception , largely because he also has five ducks to go with his two hundreds in 14 ODI innings . In the last couple of years , the ability of South Africa 's top order to score hundreds has set them apart from other sides. Since the beginning of 2013 , South Africa 's top seven batsmen have scored 30 centuries in 53 matches. Their top seven have batted 349 times to score those 30 centuries , which means they 've averaged a hundred every 11.63 innings. Other top orders have matched South Africa 's average and scoring rate , but not their frenetic rate of scoring centuries. Australia , with 20 hundreds in 299 innings , are second with a rate of 14.95 innings per hundred ; South Africa 's rate is about 22 % better. India 's top order has a better batting average , but they 've only scored a hundred once every 16 innings. Sri Lanka and West Indies have averaged around 20 innings , while the average for England and Pakistan is around 25 innings , more than twice South Africa 's rate .
