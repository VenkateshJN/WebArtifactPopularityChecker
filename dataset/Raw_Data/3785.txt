( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 CHENNAI : The BCCI is going to ask the team management about Shikhar Dhawan 's decision to not bat first thing in the morning on the fourth day of Gabba Test. The board members are extremely unhappy with the team 's capitulation after being in a strong position at one stage , and one understands the top bosses will have a word with the coaching staff on the incident that led to " unrest " in the dressing-room . " Dhawan came out to bat in less than an hour. It was surprising that he did n't do so from the beginning , because that would have helped us start in an advantageous position. It was a matter of winning the first hour and we might have won this Test on a deteriorating wicket. We have to know about the gravity of the injury , " a senior BCCI official told TOI . The team management had complained about the quality of the practice wickets at the Gabba but the BCCI is not giving too much importance to it. " Practice bowlers , practice wickets - these are eternal complaints. Sometimes the visiting teams lodge similar complaints but you have to live with it. That is the nature of international cricket , " the official added . However , reports of Ishant Sharma and Suresh Raina not getting vegetarian food in the dressing-room on the third day has not gone down too well with the BCCI. " If it 's true , we will have a word with Cricket Australia. Before every tour , the requirements of our team are sent to the host board. Still , if the players had to go out to get their food for lunch , it 's unacceptable , " the official added .
