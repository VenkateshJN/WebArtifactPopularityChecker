5 2.17 6.6 to Vijay , Big wicket for Karnataka. They draw first blood as Vijay is trapped plumb in front of middle. Vinay brings this fuller ball back into Vijay , who gets a decent stride forward , but fails to nudge the ball to the leg side and is struck on the pad. That looked plumb and the umpire raises his dreaded finger after a delay and Vinay exults 13/1 8.4 to Aparajith , gottim ! Bowled through the gate. The umpires check for a possible no ball but Vinay is fine on that count as well. Aprajith trudges back to the hut. This was the inswinger again , he seeks to push at it with lazy footwork , but the ball sneaks through the gate to hit the top of the off stump. The bail is tipped off , signalling Aprajith 's doom 21/2 24.5 to Shankar , Vinay Kumar returns and strikes. Fuller and cuts back in late to beat Shankar 's defence and strike him on the back pad in line with the stumps. Easy call for the umpire and TN are four down. Shankar did not account for the inward movement there and his footwork also left a lot to be desired 49/4 42.3 to Mukund , The change of angle has worked for Vinay Kumar and Mukund 's vigil has been ended. This one comes in with the angle from outside off on a back of a length , Mukund , hoping for the ball to move away , offers no shot , giving it a free pathway to rattle the top of middle. And with this , Vinay gets to 300 Ranji wickets 69/6 62.4 to Aswin Crist , TN have been bowled out for 134. Vinay claims another five-wicket haul. Another short ball , another wicket. Crist aims to swipe this over midwicket , but his balance is all awry as he top-edges it high into the air. Uthappa gets under it to perform the final rites on Tamil Nadu 's first innings 134/10
