( AP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 AUCKLAND : Veteran slow-bowler Daniel Vettori was hailed on Sunday as the " unsung hero " of New Zealand 's knife-edge one-wicket World Cup win over Australia for applying the brakes on the four-time champions just when they threatened a run rampage . Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 The 36-year-old , who made his one-day international debut way back in 1997 , broke the half-century second wicket stand between David Warner and Shane Watson before tempting Steve Smith to edge a catch behind to Luke Ronchi for just four in Auckland on Saturday . He finished with two for 41 off his 10 overs -- having had two for 28 off nine -- to move to 298 ODI wickets . However , Vettori 's efforts at Eden Park were overshadowed by left-arm seamer Trent Boult 's five for 27 and the explosive batting of skipper Brendon McCullum and Kane Williamson , who hit the match-winning six . " You 've got guys who are good players of spin and they like to attack spin , " said New Zealand coach Mike Hesson . " He ( Vettori ) controlled his length , just got the drift , occasionally got one to turn and got out two high-quality players. He would probably be the unsung hero. " Boult also hailed Vettori 's performance. " It definitely started off with a hiss and roar on their ( Australia 's ) part , " Boult said . " Dan came in and did his thing and really tied it up. Not just here , but the work he has done in the past has been crucial to setting up games for us.
