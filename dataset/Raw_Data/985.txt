World Cup Final : New Zealand Seek Bragging Rights Over Big-Brother Australia in Trans-Tasman Clash World Cup Final : New Zealand Seek Bragging Rights Over Big-Brother Australia in Trans-Tasman Clash Australia and New Zealand have shared a bitter cricketing past that dates back to the infamous underarm episode of 1981. Who will have the last laugh when they meet in the final of the Cricket World Cup 2015 at MCG on Sunday ? Last updated on Saturday , 28 March , 2015 23 : 25 IST Total Shares Brendon McCullum and Michael Clarke at the MCG Â© Getty Images After six weeks of intense battle , the two best teams of the tournament will clash for the World Cup at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday. For the second time running , the finale will be played between two co-hosts but the rivalry between Australia and New Zealand far outweighs any India-Sri Lanka contests . The Trans-Tasman neighbours ' bitter cricketing history goes back to 1981 when then Australia captain Greg Chappell asked his younger brother Trevor to role an underarm delivery in an inconsequential third final of a one-day tournament. The Black Caps needed six off the last ball to tie the match but the Chappell brothers ' stunt prevented tailender Brian McKechnie from even attempting a big shot. ( It 's Clarke vs McCullum in Fight to Finish ) A lot of water has passed through the Tasman Sea. Australia went on to win four World Cups , while New Zealand could not even qualify for the final. The Aussies reigned supreme in world cricket while the Kiwis only emerged occasionally to threaten teams in limited overs cricket. On Sunday though , none of that would matter. ( 'Yes , New Zealand Can Win First World Cup ' ) Australia and New Zealand have already met once in this World Cup before in Auckland , and it was Brendon McCullum 's bravehearts who carved out a one-wicket thriller. They have been unbeaten in the tournament while Australia have slowly come into their own. At the MCG , Michael Clarke 's side would have distinct home advantage but New Zealand have shown they are more than capable of holding fort against the best. Can they do it against the world 's number one ODI side in their own den ? Recent history suggests Australia have been far superior. In the last 10 ODIs between the arch-rivals , Australia have won six , lost three and one was washed out. As the World Cup finalists gear up for battle , here is a look at those 10 matches played over a span of six years ! 1. Sydney , Feb. 8 , 2009 : Australia Won by 32 Runs Australia came into this match down 2-0 in the five-match series for the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy. Brad Haddin struck a brilliant century to power Australia to 301. Despite Grant Elliott 's 115 , Australia 's seamers scripted a 32-run win after Nathan Bracken and Ben Hilfenhaus took two wickets each . 2. Adelaide , Feb. 10 , 2009 : Australia Won by 6 Wickets Mitchell Johnson led another spirited show in Adelaide , picking up three wickets to restrict the Kiwis to 244. David Hussey steered the chase with a solid 79 as Australia cruised home with six wickets to spare . 3. Brisbane , Feb. 13 , 2009 : Match Abandoned Heavy showers in Brisbane reduced the match to 22-overs-a-side and Haddin 's 65-ball 88 and same late-order hitting by Callum Fergusson helped Australia post a daunting 168. New Zealand started the chase on the right note before rain returned to force a washout . 4. Napier , March 3 , 2010 : New Zealand Won by 2 Wickets The Black Caps came out on top in a nail-biter. After Darrell Tuffey took three wickets to keep Australia to 275 , the visitors fought back hard with the ball in Napier. However , Ross Taylor 's composed 70 and an unbeaten 49 by Scott Styris ensured the Kiwis got home with two wickets and four balls to spare . 5. Auckland , March 6 , 2010 : Australia Won by 12 Runs Half-centuries by Haddin , Cameron White and Michael Hussey helped Australia to 273/7 in their 50 overs. Johnson and Ryan Harris then picked seven wickets between them to snatch a 12-run win despite some late order heroics , led by Daniel Vettori 's 49-ball 70 . 6. Hamilton , March 9 , 2010 : Australia Won by 6 Wickets Johnson and Harris were the stars again -- this time picking up three wickets each to bowl New Zealand out for a modest 245. Haddin 's 110 and a classy 69 by skipper Ricky Ponting ensured a smooth chase resulting in a six-wicket victory . 7. Auckland , March 11 , 2010 : Australia Won by 6 Wickets New Zealand 's batting fared poorly again as Nathan Hauritz picked up three wickets to bowl the Kiwis out for 238. Fifties by Ponting and White gave the Aussies another six-wicket win and with it an unbeatable 3-1 series lead . 8. Wellington , March 13 , 2010 : New Zealand Won by 51 Runs Australia would have been mighty pleased with their bowlers , who had knocked off the Black Caps for another modest total -- 241. But then they had not factored in Tim Southee , whose 4/36 took the wind out of Australia 's chase and they were bowled out for 190 , crashing to a 51-run defeat . 9. Nagpur , Feb. 25 , 2011 : Australia Won by 7 Wickets The Trans-Tasman rivals clashed in faraway Nagpur almost a year after their contests Down Under in the group stages of the World Cup in 2011. As defending champions , Australia were the obvious favourites and they played that way too. Johnson and Shaun Tait were too fast for the Black Caps and they collapsed to 206 all out. Openers Watson and Haddin struck half-centuries to seal a seven-wicket win . 10. Auckland , 28 February 2015 : New Zealand Won by one Wicket One of the greatest World Cup matches of all time was played between the co-hosts of the 2015 tournament. At a packed Eden Park , Australia 's daunting batting line-up was brought down on its knees by Trent Boult ( 5/27 ) . The Kiwis faced a modest 152-run chase and after Brendon McCullum 's 24-ball 50 , victory was a mere formality. But Mitchell Starc picked 6/28 and Australia sensed a win. Kane Williamson 's sensational six off Pat Cummins sealed a thrilling win for the Kiwis .
