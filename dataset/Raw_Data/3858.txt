Jayawardene to build grassroot cricket in Sri Lanka The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Mar 31 , 2015 , 06.58PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 COLOMBO : Former Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene is set to take over a role with the country 's cricket administration to develop the infrastructure of the local game at the feeder level . Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake said that Jayawardene , 37 , has consented to a futuristic role in restructuring the schools and junior level cricket . Jayawardene , who retired from ODIs after the World Cup , was one of the finest batsmen to come through the highly competitive school cricket set up . He was a brilliant batsman for Nalanda College in Colombo , which has produced so many Sri Lankan internationals , including Sri Lanka 's first Test captain Bandula Warnapura . In the recent years the school system has failed to produce outstanding cricketers to be fed in to the national team . Introduction of T20 cricket at school level is being seen as a major reason . In 2007 a similar role was thrust on Aravinda de Silva , a former captain and one of the finest batsmen produced by the country to revamp junior cricket . Dissanayake , after Sri Lanka 's exit from the quarterfinals of the 50-over showpiece event , has set out to revamp the local governing body administration by setting up an interim committee headed by the former Test opening batsman Sidath Wettimuny . They are to take office from Wednesday . Dissanayake 's father Gamini was instrumental in developing Sri Lanka 's local cricket infrastructure , which helped immensely in the island being admitted as a full Test nation in 1981 .
