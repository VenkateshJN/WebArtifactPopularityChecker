Memorable moments : Sachin Tendulkar masterclass The author has posted comments on this article TNN | Jan 31 , 2015 , 10.26AM IST Page 1 of 4 2003 INDIA VS PAKISTAN , CENTURION You need perfect timing , presence of mind , luck and an adventurous streak to hit an upper cut six off Shoaib Akhtar in an India-Pakistan World Cup game. You need supple wrists and positive outlook to hit a flicked four between square-leg and fine-leg on the next ball . You need sheer class to hit an extra-cover driven four off Wasim Akram 's dot-on-target delivery. You need brute force to massacre Waqar Younis ' good delivery through the covers. The above four shots were not unique . But to unleash them in such a short span of time on that stage , in such a tight chase , is what made Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar a peerless batsman . Thankfully , India did n't fumble in the chase with Rahul Dravid ( 44 * ) and Yuvraj Singh ( 50 * ) overhauling Pakistan 's 273 in the group game . Tendulkar ( 98 ) missed the century but uplifted countless souls . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
