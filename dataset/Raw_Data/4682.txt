World Cup 2015 : Kiwis favourites to beat Australia but wo n't like it , Waugh says The author has posted comments on this article Reuters | Feb 27 , 2015 , 11.20AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 MELBOURNE : New Zealand are favourites to beat Australia in their highly anticipated World Cup clash at Eden Park on Saturday but wo n't like the idea , former Australia captain Steve Waugh has said . New Zealand have won all three of their World Cup matches at a canter while Australia have a solitary win over England to their name , with their second match against Bangladesh washed out . " New Zealand will be probably entitled to be favourites in this game , the way they 've played , " Waugh said in comments published by News Ltd media on Friday . " They 've played three games so they 're in the groove. They 're probably confident and relaxed , at the peak of their powers . " It will be a parochial home crowd in Auckland. It 's a very difficult place to play and win over there . " I know the Kiwis would hate to think they 're favourites . " They always like being the underdogs and coming from nowhere so it would be nice to see them under a bit of pressure with the expectation to beat Australia and see how they handle that. " Players from both sides have this week been keen to cast their teams as the underdogs in their first meeting at the Auckland ground in five years . Though the match is expected to be a sell-out , the winners can take little more than bragging rights and a defeat would hardly dent Australia 's campaign , Waugh suggested . " Whoever loses the weekend 's game , it certainly does n't mean their World Cup has been derailed. It 's just a bit of a hiccup along the way . " We have the team and the personnel and we have the weapons , the X-factor. It 's all there. " Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
