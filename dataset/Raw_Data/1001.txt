After the trophy snub , Kamal had spoken to local television channels in Bangladesh and claimed " My rights were dishonoured. After I go back home , I will let the whole world know what 's happening in ICC. I will let the whole world know about those guys who are doing these mischievous things. " Previously , after the no-ball fiasco in the India-Bangladesh semifinal , Kamal had said , " " There was no quality in the umpiring. It looked like they took the field after it ( the outcome ) was pre-arranged. " " As the ICC president , whatever I have to say I will say it in next meeting. It could happen that maybe I will resign , " Kamal said in comments aired on Bangladeshi television . He also said that the ICC had become the Indian Cricket Council , " I can not represent the Indian Cricket Council. If someone has imposed a result on us , in that case no one can accept it. " The ICC reacted vehemently and rejected Kamal 's criticism of the umpiring during Bangladesh 's World Cup quarterfinal loss to India by calling his outburst as " unfortunate " and " baseless " . " The ICC has noted Mr Mustafa Kamal 's comments , which are very unfortunate but made in his personal capacity. As an ICC President , he should have been more considerate in his criticism of ICC match officials , whose integrity can not be questioned , " ICC CEO Dave Richardson said in a statement . " The no-ball decision was a 50-50 call. The spirit of the game dictates that the umpire 's decision is final and must be respected. Any suggestion that the match officials had " an agenda " or did anything other than perform to the best of their ability are baseless and are refuted in the strongest possible terms , " Richardson added .
