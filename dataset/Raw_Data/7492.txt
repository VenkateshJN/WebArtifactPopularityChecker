Richards ' manufactured flick for six off Hendrick 's final delivery in 1979 was the perfect finishing touch for West Indies shares Play 03 : 01 West Indies , who had been stuck in by England in the final , had recovered from 99 for 4 thanks to a fifth-wicket stand of 139 in 77 minutes between Collis King and Viv Richards . King was eventually dismissed for 86 , but Richards continued laying into a tiring England attack. When the last over of the innings began , Richards was on strike unbeaten on 124 , and facing Mike Hendrick , whose 11 previous overs had cost just 36 . Richards , with the No. 11 Colin Croft at the other end , kept strike throughout the over , taking eight runs from the first five balls. In the absence of any fielding restrictions , England 's captain Mike Brearley then had almost every fielder back on the ropes as Hendrick ran in to bowl the final delivery. Perhaps unsurprisingly , Richards flicked him for six . " I had sussed with his long-off and long-on back that it would be fullish to allow me one or two , " Richards recalled. " It was the correct ball , much fuller but slightly off the line , and I stepped to the off side and flicked it. I left the field thinking , 'That shot is my invention. ' " The newspapers waxed lyrical , with Richards ' last-ball swat attracting particular comment. Tony Cozier referred to Richards ' " dismissal of the England attack as if they were net bowlers " , while Clive Lloyd enthused at the " dramatic way he finished his innings " . The stand between Richards and King had enabled West Indies to post 286 for 9. England ran out of puff and lost by 92 runs. Richards , very much the fifth bowler , and someone England needed to milk if they were to win , followed up his ton with ten tidy overs for just 35 runs , as West Indies comfortably retained the title .
