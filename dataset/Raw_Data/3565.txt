( PTI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 MUMBAI : It was Ashok Dinda 's woeful T20 performance against England a couple of years ago at the Wankhede that got the selectors ' goat. Bowling the last over , the Bengal paceman conceded 12 runs , allowing the visitors to chase down 177 and level the series . To add insult to injury , Eoin Morgan hit him for a six off the last ball . Dinda was part of the XI that lost to the same team a few days later in an ODI in Rajkot , but his performance in Mumbai played a vital role in his wilderness from the Indian side since . It was at the same Wankhede on Wednesday evening that the enigmatic Dinda breathed fire against West Zone in the Deodhar Trophy final , taking 4 for 33 , as East Zone won by 24 runs to take the title , defending 269-8 in an absorbing contest . Dinda accounted for openers Smit Patel ( 4 runs , 11 balls ) , Sheldon Jackson ( 7 runs , 18 balls , 1x4 ) and the No 3 Ambati Rayudu ( 16 runs , 22 balls , 3x4 ) , reducing West to 37-3 in the 11th over . Kedar Jadhav ( 97 runs , 91 balls , 8x4 , 3x6 ) put up a valiant fight but his knock was not enough to help the hosts retain the title. Jadhav put on 74 for the fourth wicket with Ankit Bawne ( 28 runs , 59 balls , 1x4 ) and thereafter made the most of the reprieve that came his way when he was batting on 68 . Kumar Deobrat made a mess of a simple chance at long on as bowler Saurasish Lahiri was left holding his head in his hand. He got out three short of a well-deserved ton when he was bowled by Biplab Samantray , attempting a wild heave. By then he had put on 84 in the company of Suryakumar Yadav . Yadav ( 35 runs , 54 balls ) tried to shore things up with Axar Patel , the hero of the last game and Shardul Thakur , but Dinda was at it again when he got rid of the Mumbai captain with West still needing 27 runs for victory . Earlier , East Zone backed themselves to put up a challenging total after winning the toss. But they found themselves scrambling for cover straight away with both the openers , Ishank Jaggi ( 2 runs , 12 balls ) and Shreevats Goswami ( 0 , 8 balls ) , back in the hut by the fourth over with only five runs on the board . They eventually reached a fighting 269-8 , thanks largely to the efforts of the middle-order , which was once again brilliantly marshalled by skipper Manoj Tiwary who hit 75 ( 92b , 3x4 , 4x6 ) . Jharkhand 's Virat Sigh , all of 16-years of age , managed a gutsy 54 ( 84b , 6x4 ) while Orissa 's Samantray provided the final flourish with 60 ( 50b , 7x4 , 1x6 ) . Brief scores : East Zone 269-8 ( Virat Singh 54 , Manoj Tiwary 75 , BB Samantray 60 ; Dhawal Kulkarni 2-35 ) beat West Zone 245 ( Kedar Jadhav 97 , Surya Yadav 35 ; Dinda 433 ) by 24 runs .
