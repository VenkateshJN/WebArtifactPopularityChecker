( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 ABU DHABI : India discard Virender Sehwag blasted a 97-ball 109 to lead Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) to a comfortable six-wicket win over Durham in a Champion County Test match at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium on Wednesday . The 35-year-old Delhi batsman smashed 18 boundaries and a six in his 97-ball innings to help MCC overhaul the victory target of 225 in 51 overs on the fourth and final day . Out of the national side for more than a year , Sehwag played a captain 's knock as he added 105 runs with Samit Patel ( 48 not out ) of Nottinghamshire for the fourth-wicket . Sehwag was finally dismissed by Jamie Harrison in the 49th over of MCC 's second innings . Resuming the MCC 's second innings at overnight 48/2 , Sehwag blasted three fours in the opening over of the first session from seamer Harrison to give his team a good start in the day . The inexperienced Durham attack failed to tame Sehwag as he completed his half-century in 47 deliveries with the help of eight boundaries and then by lunch , he was only five runs short of the three-figure mark . Sehwag brought up his hundred shortly after the lunch break with a boundary off Harrison. He took 88 balls to reach his century . Harrison , however , had the last laugh as he had the Indian caught by Paul Coughlin . Electing to bat , Durham had scored 248 in their first innings but MCC replied strongly with 282. In their second innings , Durham were dismissed for 257 , leaving MCC with a target of 224 . MCC finished the third day at 48 for two in 20 overs with Sehwag on nine and DJ Bell-Drummond on 15 .
