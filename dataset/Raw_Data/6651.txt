World Cup 2015 February 10 , 2015 'Faulkner the best finisher with the bat ' - Watson Shane Watson recalls his World Cup memories and picks his impact players shares 13 Shane Watson : " To see Adam Gilchrist go absolutely bananas after he did n't have the best tournament leading up to that final was pretty amazing. " © AFP What is your first World Cup memory ? The home World Cup in 1992. That really stands out. The interesting uniforms the teams had with the colours on the shoulders , also watching the final and seeing Wasim Akram bowl those couple of incredible balls to change the game . Who will be the breakthrough player in this World Cup ? Steven Smith . Who 's the best death bowler you 've seen ? Lasith Malinga. For his consistency , where he hits his yorkers all the time in all the tournaments he 's played , it 's pretty incredible to watch but not so much fun to face ! Who is the best finisher with the bat ? I 'd say Jimmy Faulkner. He 's done it consistently for the last 18 months under a lot of pressure , he 's got it done just about every single time. So for me Jimmy by quite a long way . When is the best time to take the batting Powerplay ? A lot of it depends on the conditions but on good wickets with two new balls , 35 overs is usually a perfect time. In slower conditions , where the ball 's going to turn a bit more and get a little bit older , the earlier the better . The best World Cup match you 've watched or played in ? The 2007 World Cup final against Sri Lanka. To see Adam Gilchrist go absolutely bananas after he did n't have the best tournament leading up to that final , on such a big stage , was pretty amazing . Have you ever had a proper job ? Yeah I was a pizza delivery boy when I was 18. I actually trashed my car one night when I was trying to find the street numbers in the dark . Who will Australia play in the World Cup final ? South Africa . Daniel Brettig is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @ danbrettig © ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
