James Franklin signs for Middlesex February 6 , 2015 READ ALL Posted by Min2000 at February 7 , 2015 James Franklin was woefully mismanaged by New Zealand cricket for years -- he should have played a lot more and was a class above some of the players that kept him out of the side. I can see him scoring a lot of runs for Middlesex and getting handy wickets too. Good luck , Jimmy . Posted by whitebull3 at February 7 , 2015 when he was first picked for NZ at [ 19 ] we all had high hopes for him to be one of if not thee main strike bowler in NZ ` s attack , but it tapered away so much that has bowling ended up slower than Mills lol , Lacking confidence and his action falling away bad to the right so no hope of in swinging deliveries a LFM ` s best deliver by a Taranaki mile. but his batting picked up i dont know why allrounders lose one of their strings to their bow , could it be too much cricket or too much expectation ? . any way Middlesex is picking up a good leader middle/late order batter who on his day can demolish a attack .
