( Getty Images ) Page 1 of 4 SYDNEY : AB de Villiers confirmed his status as the most destructive batsman in cricket with a magnificent unbeaten 162 from just 66 balls to lead South Africa to a record 257-run victory over West Indies in their ICC World Cup 2015 Pool B match on Friday . Scorecard South Africa 's tally of 408 for five was the second highest posted in a World Cup match and a shell-shocked West Indies could only manage 151 in reply , Chris Gayle backing up his record 215 against Zimbabwe on Tuesday with a paltry three . Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 It was the joint fourth largest margin of victory by runs in an one-day international and also equalled the largest margin in a World Cup match , matching India 's 257-run win over Bermuda in 2007 . De Villiers earlier continued his one-man mission to redefine limited overs batting with the quickest century in one-day internationals on Australian soil ( 52 balls ) and the fastest 150 ever in the 50-over format ( 64 balls ) . Utilising his full repertoire of strokes in an awesome display of batting , he flogged the West Indies bowlers with eight sixes and 17 fours in a 104-minute knock that will live long in the memory . His last 50 runs came off just 12 balls and brought the 23,612 crowd at a sun-bathed Sydney Cricket Ground to their feet chanting " AB ! , AB ! , AB ! " . South Africa were desperate to kickstart their campaign after their 130-run defeat to India in their last Pool B match and de Villiers ensured they would . The 31-year-old shared stands of 134 runs with Rilee Rossouw ( 61 ) , 48 with David Miller ( 20 ) and an unbeaten 80 in 3.2 overs with Farhaan Behardien to turn around his country 's innings after West Indies had made a promising start to the match . West Indies captain Jason Holder , who had bowled two maidens , taken one wicket and conceded nine runs in his first five overs , ended up with figures of 1/104 after giving up 64 runs in his last two overs . Caribbean hopes of any kind of riposte to the carnage wrought by de Villiers rested largely in the hands of Gayle , who had contributed to his side 's good start by taking two wickets in the 30th over to reduce South Africa to 146/3 . The 35-year-old opener had faced just three balls , however , when he took a huge swing at a Kyle Abbott delivery and lost his leg stump . The West Indies soon looked like the demoralised rabble that lost their tournament opener to Ireland with only Dwayne Smith ( 31 ) , Denesh Ramdin ( 22 ) and Holder ( 56 ) , with his maiden ODI half century , offering more than token resistance . Spinner Imran Tahir finished with figures of 5/45 to become the first South African to take a five-wicket haul in a World Cup match .
