shares 81 Mohammad Hafeez was due to be tested in Brisbane on February 6 © AFP The PCB has asked the ICC to push back the date of the official test on Mohammad Hafeez 's bowling action due to a niggle in the bowler 's foot. The new testing date is expected to fall after February 10 , putting further doubt on Hafeez 's availability for bowling in Pakistan 's World Cup opener against India . Hafeez was due to fly to Brisbane on Friday , February 6 , for the test from Sydney where the Pakistan team is currently based , but will have to wait for the new test date . Having been suspended from bowling because of an illegal action , Hafeez can only bowl if cleared but he remains a part of the Pakistan World Cup squad and can play solely as a batsman . Hafeez 's extended unavailability as a bowler is a significant blow to Pakistan 's team composition. They are already missing offspinner Saeed Ajmal because of a suspect action , and recently lost fast bowler Junaid Khan to injury . If he fails the official test , the ICC 's Bowling Review Group ( BRG ) will specify a period during which Hafeez will not be entitled to approach the ICC for reassessment . Hafeez was first reported while playing for Lahore Lions during the Champions League T20 in September 2014 , but that sanction did not apply to international cricket. He was reported again after the first Test against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi in November . Umar Farooq is ESPNcricinfo 's Pakistan correspondent. @ kalson © ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
