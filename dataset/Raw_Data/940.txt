( Irfan Ruled out of World Cup With Hip Injury ) The seven-foot one-inch fast bowler played in the crucial victory against South Africa , taking three wickets , before missing Sunday 's game against Ireland which Pakistan won to secure their place in the last-eight . The injury is a major blow to the 1992 champions ' chances of defeating four-time winners Australia in the quarter-final at the Adelaide Oval on Friday. ( Standings ) " Irfan was one bowler who was different to all the others in the competition , " Misbah told AFP. " It is a huge setback for us but we have to live with it. " Irfan , at seven-feet one inch , the tallest man to play international cricket , took eight wickets in the five matches he played at the World Cup . His injury is the latest in a series of devastating setbacks suffered by Pakistan who have been stripped of an entire first-choice attack . " It 's difficult because we lost two bowlers to suspension before the World Cup , " said Misbah of ace spinner Saeed Ajmal and spinning all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez . " We also lost two good quality pacemen -- Umar Gul and Junaid Khan -- also to injury. Now just when we have started to perform well this injury hits us badly .

Brad Robinson , the Pakistan team 's physiotherapist , ordered a more detailed scan , which was carried out Tuesday afternoon , and it reconfirmed a stress fracture in the pelvis . " This injury rules Irfan out of the World Cup , " said Robinson .
