At the Gloucester County Ground , the match officials decided to call off the five-match series opener at 1.30 pm local time following heavy showers . The forecast for the match was never good and it started raining late yesterday night , and it did n't stop even for a until morning . The rain did subside for a 20-30 minutes , only to pour down with greater intensity thereafter and never relented for even a moment . The grounds men though were n't the ones to give up in a hurry. The whole square had been under covers since morning but they were busy clearing up rain-water. Three super soppers were put in to service but they would have been useful only if the rain had stopped . The ground staffs efforts proved even more futile when puddles started forming on the outfield , signaling that the drainage was now getting choked . The last cut-off time for the match to start was 3.45 pm local time ( 8.15 pm IST ) . For that the grounds men needed atleast an hour before that to dry off the field for suitable playing conditions to prevail. The last cut-off for that was stipulated to be 2 pm local time ( 6.30 pm IST ) , but about thirty minutes before that , the umpires walked onto the field and inspected the conditions .
