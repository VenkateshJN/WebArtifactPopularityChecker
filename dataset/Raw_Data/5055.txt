Ranji Trophy 2014-15 ( Full Coverage ) Bowlers bring Karnataka back in the game 2015/Jan/23 06 : 24 : 00 , by Vineet Ramakrishnan Text Size Baroda 's 19-year-old Deepak Hooda has become their latest crisis-man by resisting with a 135-ball 67. © BCCL More often than not , the first hour of play sets the tone for the rest of the day 's play , and when Irfan Pathan had Shreyas Gopal edging one to wicketkeeper Pinal Shah off the second ball of the day , it seemed that day three of the Ranji Trophy 2014-15 Group A fixture between Karnataka and Baroda at the Gangotri Glades will be a lively affair . It sure was one , as Abhimanyu Mithun stroked a quickfire 40 off 35 balls to reduce the deficit , which was exactly 100 at the start of play , to 46 , but Baroda eventually bundled out Karnataka for 302 , taking a decisive first-innings lead of 32. Karnataka , however , came back strongly after the break to reduce the visiting team to 65 for 4 in their second dig. Deepak Hooda , the first-innings centurion , resisted for a while with a 135-ball 67 , but the home team continued to strike regularly , and at the close of play had Baroda on the ropes at 204 for 8 , with an overall lead of 237 . For the first time this season , Karnataka conceded the first-innings lead but the defending champions showed their class with an inspired spell of fast bowling led by Sreenath Aravind ( 15-7-27-3 ) . On a pitch that was two-paced and hard to bat on according to KL Rahul , Aravind accounted for the top three Baroda wickets in quick time. He removed opener Saurabh Wakaskar ( 0 ) off the first ball of the innings by trapping him in front of the stumps and then proceeded on to castle the other opener , Kedar Devdhar ( 0 ) in his next over. After lunch , Aravind had Hardik Pandya ( 22 ) caught at first slip and part-timer Karun Nair removed skipper Aditya Waghmode for ( 23 ) to leave Baroda in a spot of bother . It looked like Karnataka , with their backs to the wall for the first time his season , where going all out before Hooda and Yusuf Pathan combined to blunt the home team 's attack. Hooda , Baroda 's latest crisis-man , cracked a backfoot drive to get things going and countered the two-paced wicket with appreciable skill. Karun ( 8-2-33-1 ) got an extended spell with the ball as his seam-up deliveries constantly bothered the batsmen. Some would keep low , while others took off the pitch surprising the batsmen. One such ball had Yusuf slashing one to gully , where Robin Uthappa failed to hold onto a tough chance . Hooda , who had got the feel of the wicket kept the scorecard ticking and hit the odd boundary while Yusuf struggled. The introduction of spin as late as the 33rd over in the form of Gopal presented Uthappa with another chance , this time off Hooda at second slip , but he grassed it once again. Dropped on 43 , Hooda passed fifty for the second time in the match with a flick off Ronit More ( 12-4-50-2 ) in 95 balls just after tea. He , however , lost the company of Yusuf ( 28 ) who was undone by a sharp incoming delivery from More to be adjudged lbw. The fifth-wicket association yielded 65 runs , and the lead had swelled past the 150-run mark , but More had Irfan Pathan caught at gully for 14 . Despite losing partners at the other end , Hooda remained calm and frustrated the Karnataka bowlers. In the 50th over , Abrar Kazi ( 13-3-31-1 ) had two close appeals against Hooda , but umpire Virender Sharma ruled it in favour of the batsman. The irate bowler had a few words with Hooda , but regained his composure to remove him three overs later , caught at silly point by R Samarth. Mithun ( 13-6-24-1 ) then scalped Shah for 8 as Baroda found themselves on 166 for 8. Swapnil Singh ( 11 * ) and Gagandeep Singh ( 19 * ) then extended Baroda 's lead past 200 and remained unbeaten at stumps . Karntaka took control of the game on day three , courtesy their fast bowlers once again , and despite conceding the first-innings lead , they remained in a good position to force an outright win on the final day . Brief scores : Baroda 335 and 204 for 8 ( Deepak Hooda 67 ; Arvind 3/27 ) lead Karnataka 302 ( KL Rahul 89 ; Swapnil Singh 4/74 ) by 237 runs . © Cricbuzz
