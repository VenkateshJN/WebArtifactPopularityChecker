Miserly Jordan sets up England win Afghanistan vs England , 38th Match , Pool A Fri , Mar 13 2015 by CB Staff Having already been knocked out of the tournament , England turned in a professional bowling performance in the dead rubber clash against Afghanistan to pick up their second win of the tournament. Chris Jordan in particular , utilized the conducive overcast conditions in Sydney to restrict the Afghans to 111/7 before a third rain interruption cut short their innings . Jordan ( 2 for 13 ) bowled unchanged between overs 10 and 20 and ended with spell figures of 5-2-9-2 successfully choking the batsmen in the middle phase of the innings. He started with a maiden , and in his next over he had Afsar Zazai caught behind with one that pitched on a good length on the off-stump and held its line to take the outside edge. Jordan 's persistent off-stump line fetched him another wicket , this time that of the in-form Samiullah Shenwari , who saw a thickish edge fly straight to point . Jordan was awarded the player of the match award for his miserly bowling performance. Speaking at the presentation ceremony , the young all-rounder had words of praise for his senior teammates James Anderson and Stuart Broad for the early strikes and stressed on the importance of putting the ball in the right areas in conducive conditions. England will be well served if Jordan can replicate such performances more consistently in the future .
