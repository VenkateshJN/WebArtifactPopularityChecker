NZ v Eng , Group A , Wellington February 20 , 2015 'An innings worthy of standing his ground when he was bowled' ESPNcricinfo staff 27 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Comment shares 27 If England thought being swung out by Tim Southee was their low point of the day , they had another thing coming. New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum strode in , slammed an eye-watering 77 off 25 balls - 74 of which came in boundaries - and knocked them out. It was the fastest fifty in World Cup cricket and almost killed the match before the supper break and they say one-day cricket meanders . As that ball started to fly , McCullum thought , " I could get this in less than ten overs " . — Jarrod Kimber ( @ ajarrodkimber ) February 20 , 2015 Shoddy work then , he let the chase travel to 12.2 . Well that 's one way to make sure you do n't have to bowl at Death of the Innings... Lose in 13 overs... ! ! ! ! — Michael Vaughan ( @ MichaelVaughan ) February 20 , 2015 But not too many people would be blaming McCullum. They were a little wowed by the batting on display . What can I say just wow wow wow McCullum @ ICC hmmm hmmm — Yohan Blake ( @ YohanBlake ) February 20 , 2015 But what could have possessed McCullum to be so belligerent ? Ok now I get it. McCullum is just playing this World Cup to get as many Kiwis a share of the $ 1 million one handed crowd catch fund — Dean Wilson ( @ CricketMirror ) February 20 , 2015 McCullum hits 2 sixes & 7 fours in his first 15 balls - 40 runs in boundaries ; 4 more than England managed. Whilst being out 10 fewer times . — Andy Zaltzman ( @ ZaltzCricket ) February 20 , 2015 If Regional stadium was a dark alley , McCullum was the boogeyman and the England bowlers would have a few sleepless nights after this. Steven Finn might be the most afflicted , as he claimed the most expensive two-over spell in ODI history . 50 % of Finn 's deliveries went for 6. # CricketBelieveItOrNot # NZvENG — Dennis Does Cricket ( @ DennisCricket_ ) February 20 , 2015 The target was 19 runs away. McCullum was four sixes from the fastest century in World Cup Cricket. But the fairytale was not to be as Chris Woakes broke through That was an innings worthy of standing his ground when he was bowled. # CWC2015 — Russell Jackson ( @ rustyjacko ) February 20 , 2015 Now that that 's done , what did the home fans have to look forward to ? New Zealand need 15 off one over to win...before the scheduled interval. # nzveng # cwc15 — Andrew McGlashan ( @ andymcg_cricket ) February 20 , 2015 Just when the umpires thought this match would n't last long enough for them to be caught under the magnifying glass.. . Just 12 to get. 41 overs to go. Nine wickets in hand. But the umpires signal a 45-minute break. Cricket , lovely cricket ! — ESPNcricinfo ( @ ESPNcricinfo ) February 20 , 2015 But there is always a reason . So glad to see the umpires taking the poor scorers into consideration and taking lunch...they must be absolutely exhausted . — Pat Symcox ( @ PatSymcox77 ) February 20 , 2015 This silly lunch break just to give ICC time to think if they would like to replace @ ECB_cricket with @ Irelandcricket in Minnows list # CWC15 — HoldingWilleyCricket ( @ holdingwilley ) February 20 , 2015 After forty-five minutes of the crowd not having to dodge cricket balls hurtling at them.. . Bets on NZ coming out after the world 's most pointless meal break and smacking the first two balls into the crowd ? # cwc2015 # NZvENG Not to be as Martin Guptill was bowled by a ball that kept a touch low New Zealand needs to work on that weakness in resuming its innings after the tea break — Sports Freak ( @ Sportsfreakconz ) February 20 , 2015 The carnage almost overshadowed a stunning display of swing bowling from Tim Southee , but bowlers tend not to forget. And team-mates certainly do n't . Timmy you absolute legend ! ! Freak ! ! — Neil Wagner ( @ NeilWagner13 ) February 20 , 2015 He was close to being a certifiable one too. Had Southee picked up one more wicket to go with his 7 for 33 , he could have had the best display by a bowler in a World Cup . Outswingers that hit top of off stump , outswingers that hit base of off stump. Today was not the day to be an England batsman. And Stuart Broad came in with the score at 108 for 6 and was out for 4 broad was willing to walk before being dismissed- how times have changed # NZvENG # CWC15 — Gaurav Kalra ( @ gauravkalra75 ) February 20 , 2015 Abject , bewildering , catastrophic , dire , excruciating , fumbling , godawful , horrific , idiotic , joyless , knackered... # EnglandAtoZ # cwc2015
