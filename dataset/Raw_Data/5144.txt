ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 ( Full Coverage ) No complaints to make against anyone : Mustafa Kamal 2015/Apr/01 11 : 45 : 00 Text Size Kamal had announced his resignation over the Cricket World Cup trophy presentation snub. © AFP Mustafa Kamal , who on Wednesday tendered his resignation from the post of ICC president , said that he was stepping down on personal grounds and had no complaints to make against anyone , according to an International Cricket Council ( ICC ) press release . Kamal had announced his resignation in a brief talk with the media in Dhaka over the Cricket World Cup trophy presentation snub and was critical of the role of ICC chairman N Srinivasan , who presented the trophy to a victorious Australian team on Sunday , but in a letter to the ICC he backtracked on his earlier outburst , in which he had threatening to expose " mischievous " designs of some people who had denied him the " constitutional right " to hand over the World Cup trophy . In his resignation letter to the ICC Chief Executive David Richardson , Kamal stated , " Let the game of cricket under the leadership of ICC touch the hearts and minds of every cricket lover. " The former Bangladesh Cricket Board chief was very vocal over a controversial no-ball decision during World Cup quarter-final match between India and Bangladesh , accusing the on-field umpires of biasness. In response to Kamal 's comments , Richardson had to clarify that Kamal 's comments were very unfortunate but were made in his personal capacity . The incident took an ugly turn when Kamal quit after the World Cup trophy was handed over to Australian captain Michael Clarke by chairman Srinivasan in the final which , according to Kamal , should have been awarded by him . © Cricbuzz
