ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 ( Full Coverage ) Vaughan wants Pietersen to quit IPL and play county cricket 2015/Mar/03 09 : 15 : 00 Text Size Michael Vaughan wants Pietersen to play county cricket. © AFP Former captain Michael Vaughan wants Kevin Pietersen to put his money where his mouth is , if he really wants to play for England again . Pietersen , who was put out to pasture following a 5-0 Ashes defeat by Australia last year , was given a big glimmer of hope on Sunday when incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chief Colin Graves suggested he was willing to move on from the controversies the batsman involved himself in following his ouster . Despite having said several times in the past that he was desperate to play for England , Pietersen has not played a competitive game in a longer format than Twenty20 since the Sydney Test in January 2014 - his last game for England . " You say it for a while you want to play for England - prove it ! " Vaughan told BBC Radio 5 Live . " Give up your IPL deal , go and play for , say , Surrey - freezing cold away at Derby . " If Kevin is going to do exactly what he 's been saying and he 's desperate to play [ for England ] , he will play county cricket and I will pretty much guarantee that he will score plenty of runs doing it. " Meanwhile , another former England captain Nasser Hussain does n't believe taking Pietersen back will help English cricket as he was past his prime. " I 've always believed in picking the best side , then managing it , " Hussain said in the Daily Mail . " But I feel there 's too much baggage with KP now . " Also , he 's not the player he once was. If he was 24 , rather than 34 , you might give him another go . " The focus should be on England 's one-day team , not Pietersen.
