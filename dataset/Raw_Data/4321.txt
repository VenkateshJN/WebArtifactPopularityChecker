( AP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 CARDIFF : Looking for a change in fortune in the limited-overs version , Indian batsman Suresh Raina struck a belligerent 100 off 75 deliveries to power the visitors to a challenging 304 for six in the second one-dayer against England on Wednesday . Put into bat , India lost a couple of early wickets after opener Shikhar Dhawan ( 11 ) and Virat Kohli ( 0 ) were scalped by Chris Woakes ( 4-52 ) with India reeling on 19 for two . But Rohit Sharma ( 52 ) and Ajinkya Rahane ( 41 ) batted sensibly to lay a solid foundation for the middle-order to build upon . Raina , registering his fourth ODI ton , then came good in the batting powerplays with Mahendra Singh Dhoni ( 52 off 51 balls ) as his able partner put on a 144-run fifth-wicket partnership to propel India to a challenging score . The Men in Blue managed 62 runs in the batting powerplays ( 35-40 overs ) without losing a wicket as Raina raced to his fifty in 49 balls . Raina 's knock was laced with 12 fours and 3 sixes but finally the aggressive left-hander fell to Woakes in the 47th over . Dhoni , hitting 6 boundaries , took over from Raina to register his 55th half-century of his ODI career but was finally cleaned up by Woakes . In the end Ravichandran Ashwin ( 10 not out ) and Ravindra Jadeja ( 9 not out ) managed 13 runs in the final over to help India cross the 300-run mark . Earlier in the innings , Rohit and Rahane also stitched a useful 91-run third-wicket partnership only to be sent back by England off-spinner James Tredwell ( 2-42 ) . England pace spearhead James Anderson ( 0-57 ) , Chris Jordan ( 0-73 ) , Ben Stokes ( 0-54 ) and Joe Root ( 0-14 ) went wicketless in the innings .
