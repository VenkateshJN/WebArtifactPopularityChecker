on March 20 , 2015 , 14 : 58 GMT When Expectations are TOO HIGH.....Even the BEST..........CHOKE ! ! IndiaNumeroUno on March 19 , 2015 , 18 : 50 GMT Yes.. I agree... SL are now officially the CHOKERS ! ! ! NixNixon on March 19 , 2015 , 14 : 58 GMT Gentlemen , I unfortunately do n't agree with your assessment of the SA chokers tag. Sounds like sour grapes to me. Yes , I am a South African fan. Shedding the chokers tag does not require , as you say , having to come through in a mini 50 runs of 28 balls to win pressure situation ; the pressure situation was the fact that we have never won a knockout game in 20 odd years. That was the pressure situation. Not winning when it counts and not putting in the big performances when it counts is what made us chokers. We have done that , we won convincingly , at last. You are basically moving your 'choker criteria ' to suit your argument. Totally ridiculous the way you argue. I dare you to post this . Alexk400 on March 18 , 2015 , 22 : 29 GMT Srilanka problem is they really have no young players to stand up. They bring kusal perrara out of blue. For me kusal perrera is good non pressure games. He ( horse ) do not play well against Pigs. More example Sehwag vs hoggard , hilfenhaus , malinga ( steyn , abbot ) Andy Zaltzman is brainy. : ) ..i can give prediction for a fee. : ) Popular Videos
