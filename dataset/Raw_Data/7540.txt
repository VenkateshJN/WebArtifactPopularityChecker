OLDEST StoneRose on April 13 , 2015 , 13 : 19 GMT Best article I 've read on Trott. It is the absence of Trott , not Pietersen , that has harmed England most since their departures . jackiethepen on April 13 , 2015 , 10 : 05 GMT This article is about Trott but it did n't take long before a " fan " has a go at Bell - he only scores in non pressure situations ! - an outrageous jibe given that in 2013 Bell held England together to win the Ashes 3-0 with three tons when the top order failed. Perhaps Dobell should reflect that Trott has always had Flower 's support. Others have not been so lucky. One is playing for Surrey to fight his way back. Bell has been at the receiving end of undeserved criticism during his whole career. Underrated , unapplauded. Other players have buckled in that position. It 's been hard for Trott but he 's had Dobell to write cogently and sincerely on his behalf. I think Trott is a good man but cricket has no mercy. You can either come back or not. Bell came back in 2009 and walked out in the must win Ashes Oval Test at 12-1 after Cook fell. He got 72 and saved the Test against Johnson 's barrage. No one writes about that. If Trott and KP succeed they will join Bell in passing that ultimate test . Sir_Francis on April 13 , 2015 , 4 : 41 GMT Love to see Trott get a ton tomorrow. And cook get a 0 ( hey , be fair. I am australian after all ) . c3vzn on April 13 , 2015 , 2 : 29 GMT " The simplistic explanation was that Trott was rattled by the pace of Mitchell Johnson. But that ignores Trott 's long-term record against him. Johnson was a member of the attack when Trott made that debut century in 2009. " Johnson of 2009 was nothing like Johnson of 2013 , that 's a ridiculous comparison. He might have had other inner demons but Mitch 's bowling was the defining blow to his confidence . nothirdman on April 12 , 2015 , 13 : 47 GMT Trott 's problem was not one bad half hour , it was walking out afterwards. Do it once and the second time is easier , especially now that mid-series seems to be the fashionable time to retire. It 's very unlikely that he will be the same on his return as he was in the glory days , but it will be fascinating to watch how he is different. He has a long way to go . CricketChat on April 12 , 2015 , 13 : 04 GMT Agree. It 's make or break for him on the field now. Think he had had enough questions asked of him since his FC comeback . Sexysteven on April 12 , 2015 , 8 : 32 GMT It 's good to see Trott back and hope he does well but it will be make or break for him hope it 's make not break he should be able to cope with the windies and nz ok but the ashes that 's another story altogether cos we all know the Aussies will go hard and prob cross that line to break down Trott again I hope he can get through that but I guess only time will tell just have to wait and c how he goes hope he can make it back successfully cos he is agood player good luck trotty Patchmaster on April 12 , 2015 , 8 : 14 GMT Hopefully him and Lythe will be a brilliant opening partnership. Unfortunately , Cook wonderful form over the last two years will keep the brilliantly in form Lythe , sat firmly on the bench. Another great example of ENG 'selecting for the future'. In reality , Cook or Trott will breakdown or lose form during the Ashes , and they 'll throw Lythe into the Gladiator pit. Great planning guys , surely we should be testing him NOW against this weak Windies attack. Play him instead of Bell , because lets face it , we already know what we need to know about Bell ( he only scores in non pressure situations ) , so lets find out about Lythe instead......sigh..... . on April 12 , 2015 , 4 : 51 GMT Lovely article George … it 's like going through the Air crash investigation series.. rewinding the last moments before the fatal blow … and now I can understand how the 'mighty calm ' Trott was brought down by stress. Mental scars are hard to heal.. Marcus Trescothick never returned to wear English shirt again … Hoping the best for Trott ! Aussie_Nate on April 12 , 2015 , 2 : 39 GMT I cant wait to see him in the ashes. We 'll open with short stuff with MJ from end and Ryno nipping it around off stump from the other end. When MJ finishes his spell , Starc will pepper him with seinging yorkers. If can get through that. Then hats off StoneRose on April 13 , 2015 , 13 : 19 GMT Best article I 've read on Trott.

Then hats off YogifromNY on April 12 , 2015 , 0 : 24 GMT Typical George Dobell article : well written , insightful and interesting. I wish Trott well and pray he will flourish once again. It actually takes guts to be open about what he has gone through. Kudos to you , Jonathan , and hope you will have more balance in your life now. And everyone 's fond of jumping on this English establishment - myself included. But give them credit for not giving up on Trott and allowing him the time and space to recover and the opportunity to play at the highest level again ! on April 12 , 2015 , 0 : 20 GMT Honestly Trott is a class player .His exit was what started the Englands decline .Hope he is back with a bang and then plays the Ashes . on April 11 , 2015 , 22 : 40 GMT Fantastic article...Trott sounds like he has been through a lot and will hopefully come back stronger. Deserves another chance...Lyth will get his chance in the future TheDoctor394 on April 11 , 2015 , 20 : 53 GMT Wonderful article , and , as a struggler with severe depression myself , I 'm full of admiration for Jonathan 's return to Test cricket. I really did not expect him to make it back , but I wish him , and England , all the best this year . on April 11 , 2015 , 20 : 44 GMT Wishing Trotters the very best ! ! ! ! ! ! Glad to see he is ( making his way ) BACK ! ! caldruid on April 11 , 2015 , 20 : 26 GMT Class player. Hope he regains his form . wolfgang68 on April 11 , 2015 , 19 : 49 GMT Trott just got back let him settle in to the squad and test match level. The negative tone of blogging in last few years is negative and not objective or truthful of the situations. We need honest coverage now. GEORGE DOBELL has always set the example ! gulubax786 on April 11 , 2015 , 19 : 40 GMT Trott is going to have his middle stump catapulted by a Jerome taylor in swinger . on April 11 , 2015 , 19 : 27 GMT " Cricket is virtually 12 months a year so if something builds up and is not kept in check it can overtake everything else. " ~ Wow , says a lot of things , do n't blame Trott or any int'l cricketer for undergoing such a harrowing experience. When you are consumed by your professional travails without a steady balance in life , I think that 's when you can lose your head , or far worse ! landl47 on April 11 , 2015 , 18 : 23 GMT Having had a brush with depression myself , I wish Trott all the best. My fear is that the pressure in an Ashes series is so much greater than anything else he has been through since Brisbane that the demons will come rushing back . The good news is that there is much to enjoy in life without putting yourself through agony. If he can cope , then good for him. If not , then he will be able to say he gave it a shot and can retire to more placid waters in peace . It worked for Marcus Trescothick . engi45 on April 11 , 2015 , 15 : 14 GMT ashes will be great series of this year but before that england have to beat zewzeland this nz side is resurgent side with bowling attack of southee , andy mills , dougie bracewell equal with australia and south africa. With this attack newzeland acan win test series in india also after 40 yrs . BRUTALANALYST on April 11 , 2015 , 15 : 13 GMT Everyone deserves a second chance not everybody gets them but I 'm glad he has he comes across as a genuine nice guy not to mention he is the closest thing England have had to a Dravid or Chanderpaul good luck to him . on April 11 , 2015 , 13 : 14 GMT Great article but really Trott is not the issue with this team. Get rid of the board living in the 19th Century , bring back KP , reshuffle current squad and Trott scores a double. Warner and co will soon be silenced , otherwise beware ! on April 11 , 2015 , 12 : 38 GMT Lovely writing , George. I hope Trott shines . McWheels on April 11 , 2015 , 11 : 45 GMT It is entirely right and proper that he has earned his place back in the side. The only sad thing will be the inevitable comments on his mental health from a deeply disrespectful Australian side in the middle. I for one would see him grind out session after session of dull , attritional runs and leave a wake of broken Aussie seamers behind him. That would be just reward . Jaffa79 on April 11 , 2015 , 11 : 23 GMT A fine article with good perspective. I think we fans lose track of the internal pressures players put themselves under. A lot of people in history who have suffered some form of breakdown put too much pressure on themselves and find their own expectations the hardest thing to conquer. Trott deserves another go and I hope he copes if he suffers another downturn in form ; that could spell the end for him. I also hope the posters on this page do n't resort to the petty mudslinging that sometimes occurs. I read that experts state that up to 15 % of elite athletes across sport suffer from various types of depression and I think we all need to be aware of this . No featured comments at the moment .
