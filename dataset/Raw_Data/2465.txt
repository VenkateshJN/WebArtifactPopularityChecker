Former players have called for his head but the England and Wales Cricket Board ( ECB ) has backed their skipper for now . Captain Cook , however , knows that neither he nor England can afford another series loss. The England captain , who used the short break between the Sri Lanka and India series to rejuvenate himself , talked during an interactive session about his own form during an interactive session with the media on Tuesday . " Never felt that I 'd been hitting the ball badly this summer. It 's just that I have n't been able to transform stay at the wicket into runs. Desperate to do that , " he said .

" As a batsman your job is to go in there and score runs for the country. It does n't matter whether you are the captain or not , " he said . " The possibility of separating the two has never crossed my mind. When someone is running in to bowl at me , I am not thinking about what fields I would set. When you are captain , your mind works overtime , but I do n't see that as a problem. I just need to get back to scoring runs , " Cook added .
