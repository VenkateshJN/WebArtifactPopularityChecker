Madrid president Florentino Perez called an impromptu press conference on Thursday to deny rumours that Ancelotti could be sacked if the European champions lose El Clasico against Barcelona next weekend . " I have always understood criticism as part of my job , " Ancelotti said on Saturday . " Coaching Real Madrid means coaching the biggest team in the world and if you do that then you get the most criticism too. It is an honour for me to coach this club. " Los Blancos squeezed into the last 16 of the Champions League in midweek despite am embarrassing 4-3 home defeat to Schalke - their fifth defeat in 15 games in 2015 . That run of form has also seen Ancelotti 's men surrender top spot in La Liga to Barcelona for the first time in five months and with little room for error ahead of their trip to the Catalan capital next Sunday . And the Italian admitted there could be changes for the visit of Levante on Sunday , but insisted he would continue with his same attacking philosophy . " The president always evaluates the work that we do and some things could change . " We have looked at what has happened and in an ideal world we will change things , but without losing our identity . " We have a clear identity and in the past few games we have n't shown it. " Ancelotti should be able to recall both Luka Modric and Sergio Ramos back into the starting line-up after long term absences due to muscle injuries . Meanwhile , full-backs Dani Carvajal and Marcelo will return after being rested in midweek . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
