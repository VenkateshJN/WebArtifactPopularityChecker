Thrashed by India at Barabati and Motera , Angelo Mathews ' Lankans have hardly made India sweat in the series so far. Virat Kohli 's Team India are on a roll and with Test berths for the series against Australia at stake , young men like Ambati Rayudu and Akshar Patel are expected to pack a little more punch in Hyderabad on Sunday . Kohli wants India to treat every game like a knock-out . © BCCI The Lankans will look up to their senior pros to deliver at Hyderabad. Much of Lanka 's fortunes have depended on how Kumar Sangakkara , Mahela Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan perform. For years , this trio has been the fulcrum of the team around which the innings develops. Known to raise their levels in crunch games , expect the veterans to play their roles on a flat batting deck . Mathews has been the only standout performer. Mathews ' 92 not out in Ahmedabad took him to the top of the 2014 ODI run-scorers ' list . He has hit 838 runs at 64.46 this year. But this is not a T20 match. The captain need more contributions from both the batsmen and bowlers. No captain wants to lose by playing sub-par cricket . Sri Lanka have to get their strategies right . © PTI Before this tour , Sri Lanka had won 15 of their 20 matches in 2014. Of those , 12 ( out of 14 ) had been overseas victories. They may have been reluctant to tour India - this series was hurriedly arranged after West Indies pulled out - but there is no excuse for a lack of attitude when competing on the field. India will want Sri Lanka to compete in conditions where they can really thrive . Kohli has led the team well. Rayudu , who scored his maiden ODI century in Motera , is the man in focus. A good knock will guarantee him a berth in the squad for Australia. " Rayudu is one of those batsmen who has a different set of skills -- to bat the full 50 overs. He can come in the middle order and rotate. It was a great show of temperament , and the character and the class that we know he possesses. " That means Suresh Raina will have to score a big one and impress the selectors as the middle-order is looking choc-a-bloc with a clutch of good options available to Sandeep Patil and his 'wise ' team. Expect Stuart Binny to get a game too .
