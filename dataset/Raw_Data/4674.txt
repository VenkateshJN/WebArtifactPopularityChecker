READ ALSO : Pakistan 's collapse a record bad start in ODIs " He is not willing to bat up the order to protect the other players at a time when he needs to show inspiration . " He is happy with his own runs and I do n't know what coach Waqar Younis wants. He has no game plan or direction for the team , " added the man known as the Rawalpindi Express , who won 46 Test caps and played in 163 one-day internationals . Misbah , 40 , has been a successful Test captain since taking charge in 2010 and has also led the one-day squad since 2011 . He batted at number five against West Indies in Christchurch on Saturday but made only seven as Pakistan were bowled out for 160 to slump to their second straight defeat in the competition . Younis Khan has failed miserably with the bat in the tournament , leading to calls of retirement from ODIs. ( AP Photo ) Former Test captain Ramiz Raja also believes it is time for senior batsman Younis Khan to step down after failing in the opening two World Cup matches . " I beg of Younis. Thank you for your services to Pakistan cricket but please leave this ODI side now , " said Ramiz . " I think Younis should tell the management he should be rested. Our fielding has also been a joke but we need just one good match to get back on the winning track. " Another former captain Mohammad Yousuf called for wholesale changes to be made after the World Cup . " The problems ailing our cricket will not go away unless we produce better batsmen and the management is reshuffled , " Yousuf said . Former Test spinner Saqlain Mushtaq was also scathing in his criticism . " We went to pieces against a West Indies side hit by internal issues so what can we expect from this team in the remaining games ? , " said Saqlain .
