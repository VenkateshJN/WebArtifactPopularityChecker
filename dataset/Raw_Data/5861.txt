Graphs Folks , that 's all we have from this game. You can now switch tabs to follow the game between Pakistan and Zimbabwe. On behalf of Bhanu , Sriram and my co-commentator , Akshay Maanay , this is Sidhant Maheshwari signing off. Take care. See you ! After their defeat against New Zealand , Sri Lanka have made a fantastic comeback in this World Cup , winning three games in a row. They are now likely to finish either second or third in Pool A , depending on the result of their clash with Australia. On the other hand , England now have to win their game against Bangladesh to have any chance of qualifying for the quarters . Let 's take a look at some of the interesting tweets from this game : @ cricketaakash : 13000 ODI runs in matches as a wicketkeeper...imagine the time he 's spent wearing pads and gloves. Incredible. # Sangakarra # Legend @ bhogleharsha : It must be boring being no 4 or 5 in the Sri Lankan team. ! @ mohanstatsman : Sri Lanka 2nd team to win by 9 wkts while chasing 300 + in ODIs after India 362/1 beat Aus at Jaipur 16-10-2013 @ glennmcgrath11 : Brilliant run chase by @ OfficialSLC to chase down @ ECB_cricket 309. Great batting by Thirimanne & @ KumarSanga2 @ rgcricket : . @ KumarSanga2 raced to his 100 off just 70 balls today- fastest of his 23 hundreds. Previous fastest was off 73 balls in last game ! @ cricket_U : Highest targets successfully chased in WC matches : by Sri Lanka vs Eng , today by Sri Lanka vs Zim , 1992 by Ireland vs Eng , 2011 Mathews : 'I thought it was a very good wicket. Probably , 310 was a bit too much , but it was a brilliant partnership between Sangakkara and Thirimanne. We knew we had to dig deep and try and bat through the innings. We knew we could chase it down if we bat through the innings. It was two of the greatest knocks I have ever seen. That 's what we want , if the bowlers fail , the batters need to step up their game and try and get us a win. The top 4 have been brilliant in the past three games and hopefully , we can continue in the future as well. I think our fielding was n't up to the standard. We have to improve our fielding and bowling. There are not many teams who have chased 300 in the World Cup , but I think it was a great performance coming through the previous game and to pull off a similar performance in this game against the better attack was great. All that matters are the quarter-finals and the journey afterwards. We are getting there slowly and hopefully , we can peak when we reach the quarters.' Morgan : 'We certainly lost it with the ball. At half-time we went in thinking that we had an above par score. All credit to Joe Root , magnificent in the way he played. I think he is the youngest English cricketer to score a World Cup hundred which is just great. It shows what sort of form he is in. I was happy at half-time. I thought Sri Lanka probably had 7-8 overs spell , where they bowled particularly well and tied us down. But again at that stage of the game , we got through and built it up for the back end. I think if you look back at the New Zealand game , it was an area where we lost wickets and continued to do so , again it was an improvement today. We are very flexible in our batting order. We are always talking how we can be ahead of the game. Again I thought it was the right move to send James ( James Taylor ) in. Today , we probably bowled a bad ball every one , one and a half overs. At this level , you get punished for it and we were punished today by a very experienced side. I think we have got variations in two tall bowlers and they get bounce when they bowl well. We have two swing bowlers , who are accurate when they bowl well. But today , we were way off the mark. It does n't concern me at all ( regarding one dimensional bowling attack with no bowlers who can change their pace ) . When we are bowling well it 's a good attack. But , you can pick it apart if we are not bowling well. And today , we did n't bowl well. Both games that are left are pretty crucial but we have to dust ourselves off. There are positives that we can take from today. Our bowlers are pretty experienced , we do n't have to look far where we went wrong. Hopefully , we can rectify that before the Bangladesh game.' Sangakkara : 'Well , the wicket was pretty good. Everything I tried came off. I think the real credit should go to the openers here. They had a great stand and I think that kind of start and that kind of solidity at the top really helped us. I think Thiri ( Lahiru Thirimanne ) batted out of his skin , that was an exceptional innings from Thirimanne. We were getting 5.5-6 runs per over right throughout. It was just the case of making sure we batted long and build a good enough partnership. Even if we had to chase 10 an over in the last 9-10 overs , we were pretty confident that we could do it. It is always an imposing target when someone goes over 300. I thought Joe Root again batted brilliantly , they got a good start as well. We were n't probably the best with the ball as well and in the field. When there are days like these , your batting side has to step up. Getting old quite quickly ( smiles ) , but I am still enjoying it ( when asked about giving up on cricket after the World Cup ) . But , it was great to watch Thirimanne bat , I think he has done the hard job for us. He has batted everywhere from 1 to 9 , watch him get that 100 was exceptional.' Sangakkara is the Man of the Match for his unbeaten 86-ball 117 Earlier in the day , England set a target of over 300. Bell provided a bright start and Root capitalised on the platform that was set. He went on to score his 4th ODI hundred and became the youngest English cricketer to score a century in a World Cup game. Buttler provided the impetus to take the score past the 300-mark. Mathews and Dilshan were the most disciplined of the Sri Lankan bowlers. With this loss , England have made it difficult for themselves to qualify for the quarter-finals , while Sri Lanka are slowly gathering momentum as this was their third win of the competition . England bowlers lacked the penetration. Anderson has looked out of sorts since the start of the World Cup. Broad is nowhere close to his best. Finn has been very inconsistent. Woakes was the only bowler who had some decent form coming into the game , but he too was put to the sword. Moeen Ali was the only wicket-taker today , but he was unable to contain the batsmen in the middle overs . He scored his first fifty in 45 balls and the next in 25 , recording his fastest ODI hundred. On the other hand , Thirimanne kept going and played some delightful cover drives. Like Root , he too made the most of the dropped chance. Together the pair added an unbeaten 212 runs for the second wicket. At no point in time , they looked under pressure and always had the run-rate in check . A comprehensive victory for Sri Lanka. The run-chase was paced to perfection. Dilshan and Thirimanne started off steadily and got going once they were set. The latter got two reprieves , first on 3 and then on 98 , but apart from that it was a brilliant innings. Dilshan got out just when the opening stand reached the 100-run mark. However , that brought the in-form Sanga to the crease. The experienced batsman was simply outstanding in his innings . Sanga and Thirimanne finish unbeaten and are all smiles. Thirimanne punches the air in delight and Sanga hugs him as well. Both of them shake hands with the English players as they walk off the field . 47.2 Woakes to Thirimanne , SIX , Thirimanne finishes off in style. This is their third win on the trot.

Pitch Report : " It looks like a very good surface. It is exactly the same pitch that England played New Zealand on about a week go. Quite a bit of grass rolled into the surface. It feels quite firm. The average score here is 215. It will be a good even contest between bat and ball , " reckons Michael Atherton . Teams : Sri Lanka ( Playing XI ) : Lahiru Thirimanne , Tillakaratne Dilshan , Kumar Sangakkara ( w ) , Mahela Jayawardene , Angelo Mathews ( c ) , Dimuth Karunaratne , Dinesh Chandimal , Thisara Perera , Rangana Herath , Lasith Malinga , Suranga Lakmal England ( Playing XI ) : Ian Bell , Moeen Ali , Gary Ballance , Joe Root , Eoin Morgan ( c ) , James Taylor , Jos Buttler ( w ) , Chris Woakes , Stuart Broad , Steven Finn , James Anderson England have won the toss and have opted to bat Mathews : " We have been playing really good cricket against them and in the last two games. So , hopefully , we can repeat the same performance again. I would have batted first as well. The wicket might assist the fast bowlers a little bit in the first 10-15 overs. So , we will look to exploit that early on. They are all fit. We played some good cricket in the last game. So , hopefully we can continue. You got to peak at the right time and hopefully , we can peak from here onwards. " Morgan : " The last game we played here was a little bit of a disaster. Again , looking to rectify and build on our performance against Scotland here today. We have played a lot of cricket here before and the last game we played , we learned something about the ground , it swung a little bit and the wicket played a little differently than we expected. We are going to have a bat. Again , it 's similar to the other day. Looked a really good wicket and the sun is out. Again , if it does swing , that will be no surprise to us. Hopefully , we will bat better. We are unchanged today. We have been out of our tracks little bit late , but hopefully , the Scotland game will give us a little bit of momentum for our performance today and we are all looking to win a game of cricket today. " Head-to-Head : England and Sri Lanka have played each other 9 times in World Cups , with the former winning 6 of those games. However , off late it is the Islanders , who have had the better of them , winning the last 2 matches in 2007 and 2011 . England Moeen Ali was outstanding in the game against Scotland. The southpaw scored a superb hundred and gave the foundation to set a massive score. The middle-order , however , did not capitalize and could only manage to scrape past 300. Nonetheless , the bowlers did not disappoint. Steven Finn put the horrors of McCullum 's bashing to rest with a terrific display. He scalped 3 wickets and was the pick of the bowlers. England might bring in Ravi Bopara for Gary Ballance , who has not fired in all the three matches that he has played in the World Cup . England return to Wellington , the same place where they were blown away by Tim Southee. But , according to Chris Woakes they have put that behind them. And they must as this is a very important game for them. Having lost their first two games to Australia and New Zealand , England managed to register their first win in the competition against Scotland. So , if they lose this , then they will make it more difficult for themselves to qualify for the quarter-finals . Sri Lanka The problematic areas for them is the over dependancy on the big three - Dilshan , Sangakkara and Mahela. As it can be seen , in the two wins that they have registered , these three veterans have played crucial roles. Thirimanne , Mathews and Karunaratne have all got starts , but have not converted them into big scores and that is where experience comes in. Malinga is slowly getting back to his best and that was evident in the game against Bangladesh. Herath has done the holding job to perfection , but they need him to take wickets as well. One bowler who has been consistent is Suranga Lakmal. The tall fast bowler has hit the deck hard and troubled the batsmen. However , they need all of them to fire in unison . Sri Lanka have been inconsistent. Though they have registered two back-to-back wins , they still have areas of concern. After being outplayed in their first game against New Zealand , the Islanders managed to claw their way past a spirited Afghanistan , thanks to a brilliant ton from Mahela Jayawardene and some late order hitting from Thisara Perera. The most convincing win came against Bangladesh in their last game. Dilshan and Sangakkara notched up hundreds , set a mammoth target and then the bowlers restricted the opposition quite comfortably . These two countries have played each other a lot in the recent past. With 8 wins out of 12 games last year , Sri Lanka hold the upper hand in their head-to-head meetings recently. But , that might count to nothing as this is the World Cup and this is the stage where it matters the most. Let us have a look as to how both teams have fared so far in the tournament . The World Cup just got spicier the last couple of days. There were some close fought contests. And we also witnessed one of the best games of the tournament so far. The New Zealand-Australia game had everything in it and in the end it was the Kiwis , who prevailed in a nail-biting finish. Today , we travel back towards Wellington , where England take on Sri Lanka. A crucial match for both teams as we enter the second phase of the group stage . Preview : England are back in Wellington , where on February 20 they were bowled out for 123 in 33.2 overs and lost to New Zealand by eight wickets with 226 balls remaining. That defeat equaled their heaviest defeat in terms of balls remaining , and against Sri Lanka at the Westpac Stadium on Sunday they will be looking to be much , much better than their last trip here . Chris Woakes , the fast bowler who emerged from Brendon McCullum 's assault with exemplary figures of 3-1-8-2 on that dismal day last Friday , chose not to dwell on any possible trepidation of England 's return to the 'Cake Tin ' and instead said this World Cup fixture was an opportunity to go back and right a wrong . " I think we 've got a good opportunity to turn things around really , " he told reporters ahead of a training session at the Basin Reserve at the other and of Wellington. " Obviously , last time we were there it did n't exactly go to plan. It 's hard to read too much into that game , I suppose. We were pretty poor. We obviously did n't get a total on the board , and Tim Southee bowled exceptionally well , as well. Hopefully we 're past that now and can put that behind us , but it would be good to get back there and show people what we can do. I think it 's a good opportunity for us to put that completely behind us , and as I said before , show people what we can do and put in a solid performance. " To be better , England will need to bat better. In their last match , against Scotland in Christchurch , they were 172 for 1 in 30.1 overs and ended up with 303 for 8. After Ian Bell and Moeen Ali departed , Gary Ballance , Joe Root and James Taylor fell cheaply and skipper Eoin Morgan was far from fluent during his 42-ball 46. It is likely that Ballance will lose his place at No 3 , with Ravi Bopara fitting back into the batting order . These two teams know a lot about each other , having played 12 ODIs in the last 12 months. Sri Lanka won eight of those in the course of series wins home and away , and so England know what their challenges are. During their 5-2 defeat in Sri Lanka , England often competed in spurts and struggled against spin overall , with only Root really showing a masterly grip of how to score off Sri Lanka 's slow bowlers. While spin is not expected to play a big factor in Wellington - after Daniel Vettori 's 20 wickets in 20 ODIs here , the next most successful spinner is Jeetan Patel with seven - England will need to be wary of the threat in Sri Lanka 's ranks . With Jeevan Mendis ruled out of the World Cup due to injury , the spinning responsibility has increased on veteran Rangana Herath , and Sri Lanka coach Marvan Atapattu hinted at playing the offspinner Sachithra Senanayake who has 14 wickets in seven ODIs against England at an average of 14.57 and economy of 3.73. Herath , 36 , has featured in each of Sri Lanka 's World Cup games so far , taking two wickets while playing a holding role and Atapattu felt he was doing well. " Rangana has been good , but it 's different conditions for him , " he said. " Obviously the ball has n't turned as much as it does , but having said that , our seven match series against New Zealand , he was a big factor when we won , the two games that we won , so on the day , on the wicket , conditions may change. " Sri Lanka have bounced back from defeat in the tournament opener in Christchurch on Valentine 's Day , winning against Afghanistan and Bangladesh to currently occupy second place in the Pool A points table. While the Afghanistan win took some doing - they won with four wickets and ten balls in hand - there was enough for Atapattu to believe the team was ready for tougher examinations . " Certainly , the last two games have been good for us , although we came very close it was a very close game against Afghanistan , " he said. " Having said that , we would expect our No 8 to score the way he scored in the Dunedin game. Yes , we would like to take game by game at this stage. We know in World Cups every game is important , and peaking at the right time is the most important thing. We as a group believe in that , and we think game by game , and hopefully we have a good result tomorrow. " Sri Lanka did not train at the Basin Reserve today owing to what Atapattu termed " a tough day " of travelling from Melbourne , and players were allowed much-needed downtime. Several of them took to the streets of Wellington , with Lahiru Thirimanne enjoying a leisurely stroll of the city 's central business district on his own. England trained under a harsh sun , following two days of what Woakes termed as " hard practice " , undoubtedly seeking to get their World Cup campaign on track. The forecast for Sunday is warm , but Wellington 's notorious wind can be expected to play a factor .
