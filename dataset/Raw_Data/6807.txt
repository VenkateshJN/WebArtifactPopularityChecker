shares 18 Brendon McCullum examines his arm after taking a hit © Getty Images A nation held its breath for a moment when Brendon McCullum was struck on the arm by Mitchell Johnson at Eden Park , but the prognosis for the New Zealand captain is positive with no initial signs of serious injury . The blow occurred in the third over of the innings when Johnson went into short-pitched mode and McCullum could not get out of the way of the delivery. Images showed extensive swelling on his forearm , but below the elbow which could have been a far nastier area to be struck . He was not sent for an x-ray or scan after his innings of 50 off 24 balls , instead receiving ice treatment in the dressing room. McCullum appeared at the post-match presentation with the arm heavily strapped but was in good spirits after New Zealand 's hairy one-wicket victory . A spokesman said the arm was " very sore " and he will be reassessed on Sunday morning ahead of the team splitting up for a few days prior to their next match against Afghanistan in Napier next Sunday . " I think he 's okay , " Kane Williamson said. " It 's a bit of a concern when a ball that fast hits you on the arm , but he 's tough competitor so I 'm sure he 'll be fine . Although McCullum was clearly feeling the injury for the rest of his innings , it did not significantly hamper him as he clubbed a further six fours and a six before picking out mid-off which began New Zealand 's first wobble . McCullum may now be grateful of another lengthy gap before the Afghanistan game. If he was forced to miss a match at the tournament , Williamson would be the man to step into the captaincy but it would leave a vast hole to fill in the hosts ' team .
