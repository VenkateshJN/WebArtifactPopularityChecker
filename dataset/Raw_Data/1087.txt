( Rajasthan Royals Pacer Kane Richardson Ruled Out ) The all-rounder said his main focus next summer will be first class cricket as he aims to add to the one Test cap he earned way back in 2013 . " After a few days celebrating with the squad and a couple relaxing in Hobart with friends and family , now my attention turns to the IPL , and getting back into the Australian Test squad - that is my goal now , " Faulkner was quoted as saying by Cricket Australia ( CA ) . The 24-year-old played just three Sheffield Shield matches this summer as he focused predominantly on One-Day International ( ODI ) cricket leading into the World Cup. But he said he would shift his approach next season . " I would like to play Test cricket , that 's the pinnacle , and the path is pretty simple , " he said . " I will have the opportunity to play more Sheffield Shield games for Tasmania next season. I 've just got to make sure I do well with bat and ball and hopefully the rest can take care of itself , " Faulkner said . Faulkner 's one and only Test to date came in the fifth Ashes Test at The Oval in 2013 , where he took six wickets and contributed quick fire innings of 23 and 22 . He will head to India on Sunday to join fellow Australians Shane Watson , Steven Smith and Ben Cutting at Indian Premier League ( IPL ) team Rajasthan Royals .
