Top Fives January 9 , 2015 The duck hunters Batsmen who have made the most ducks in cricket 's biggest tournament shares 14 The 1996 World Cup opener was a rare high point for Nathan Astle in cricket 's showpiece event © Getty Images Innings : 22 Ducks : 5 Astle got the 1996 World Cup going with a century in the opening match , before his form deserted him on cricket 's biggest stage. Two blobs sandwiched scores of 1 , 2 , 6 , 1 , 4 , 4 and 2 over two World Cups. In 2003 , he had an unbeaten century against Zimbabwe , but that was promptly followed by two more zeroes in the Super Sixes . Outside the World Cup , Ijaz had nine ducks in 206 innings © AFP Innings : 26 Ducks : 5 Ijaz scored five zeroes in four World Cups. The first of those was in perhaps the most significant washed-out ODI of all - against England in 1992 , when Pakistan escaped with a point despite being bowled out for 74 and earned a point that helped them make the semi-finals. The last was in another significant game - the defeat in 1999 to Bangladesh , which speeded up their entry into the Test club . Kyle McCallan at the World Cup : 0 , 0 , 20 * , 5 , 3 , 0 , 5 , 0 © AFP Innnings : 8 Ducks : 4 Offspinning allrounder McCallan took 10 wickets at 23.30 to finish as one of Ireland 's most effective bowlers in the 2007 World Cup. He was less effective with the bat : starting with two zeroes and finishing with another. McCallan had only five ducks in his three-year ODI career , but four of them came in just over a month in the West Indies . Keith Arthurton had little to smile about during the 1996 World Cup © Getty Images Innings : 13 Ducks : 4 Whenever the conversation veers to woeful batting performances at the World Cup , West Indian batsman Arthurton 's name pops up. His 1996 double dose of a batting average of 0.40 and bowling average of 106.00 will be tough to top . Two more zeroes will take AB de Villiers to the top of the pile © AFP Innings : 15 Ducks : 4 He may well be the world 's best all-format batsman , but de Villiers could end up with an unwanted record. His feast-and-famine 2007 World Cup included four zeroes and a couple of masterclasses - an audacious 92 in pursuit of Australia 's 377 , and a brutal 146 against West Indies . He faced few problems in 2011 , though , with two more hundreds , and looked a class apart in the quarter-final before his run-out precipitated another early South Africa exit . Honourable mention : Kenya 's Shem Ngoche : three balls faced in the World Cup , three ducks . © ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
