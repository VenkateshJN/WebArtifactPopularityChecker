World Cup 2015 : Australian batsman try helmets with neck safety feature The author has posted comments on this article IANS | Mar 12 , 2015 , 10.49PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 HOBART : Australian cricketers on Thursday tried out a new helmet attachment that is designed to protect back of the neck and head . At training , the likes of Steven Smith , Glenn Maxwell and George Bailey all sported the new 'Masuri StemGuard ' helmet safety attachment during their net sessions , reports cricket.com.au . British manufacturer Masuri earlier this month unveiled the StemGuard - made of honeycomb plastic and foam. It offers additional protection to the exposed back of the head and neck . The step to manufacture such a helmet came after November 27 , 2014 , when Australia batsman Phillip Hughes , 25 , was hit on the back of his head by a bouncer during a domestic match. He succumbed three days later in a hospital . " Our objective for the last three months has been to make available , as quickly as possible , a guard that offers players extra protection for the vulnerable area at the back of the head and neck , " Masuri managing director Sam Miller said in a statement last Saturday . Sri Lanka 's left-handed run-machine Kumar Sangakkara and skipper Angelo Mathews both had the attachment during their match against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Sunday , and the former used it again against Scotland in Hobart on Wednesday . Cricket Australia executive general manager of Team Performance Pat Howard said : " The players have now been given the guards to trial at training before deciding whether they wear them in match conditions. It is very much a personal decision which we will respect. " Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device . Recent Messages ( )
