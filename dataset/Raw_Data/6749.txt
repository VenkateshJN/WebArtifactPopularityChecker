India v South Africa , World Cup 2015 , Group B , Melbourne February 22 , 2015 Philander under injury cloud shares 22 File photo : Vernon Philander could bowl only four overs in the match © Getty Images Vernon Philander will undergo a scan on Monday to determine the severity of the injury to his left hamstring. He bowled just four overs and was off the field for most of India 's innings , but returned to bat later in the game. South Africa will not be able to take a call on his availability for their next match against West Indies , in five days ' time , until the outcome of his medical is known . Philander delivered just one spell at the start of the Indian innings , without taking a wicket , and left the field shortly afterwards. He returned after the first drinks break , but only briefly , and was off the field for the bulk of the rest of the innings. That meant South Africa were without one of their four frontline bowlers for 42 overs and needed JP Duminy to bowl seven overs - more than he may otherwise have done . This is the second injury concern a South African strike bowler has suffered within as many matches. Dale Steyn complained of a blocked nose and sore throat on the night of South Africa 's opener against Zimbabwe and the resulting sinus kept him out of South Africa 's first training session in Melbourne on Wednesday. He returned to training for the sessions on Thursday and Friday , but Philander struggled. Philander received treatment for a stiff hamstring on Friday but was passed fit for the game .
