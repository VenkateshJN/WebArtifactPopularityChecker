The celebrations , which began soon after the winning runs over New Zealand were scored , gathered in momentum as the night went on. There were mid-pitch celebrations at 2am , a lot of clubbing , selfies at sunrise and then a victory parade at Federation Square on Monday , where thousands were assembled . The fans had waited for a while , but they finally got to see the victorious team , all sporting stylish shades , perhaps to hide the bleary eyes. Just how hard the players celebrated was evident when Aaron Finch revealed he hadn ’ t changed out of his playing gear till 10.30am in the morning , when he had a shower ! “ It ’ s an incredible feeling. It ’ s something you can only dream about as a kid and for it to come to reality is just unbelievable , ” said Finch. “ I think we ’ ve got every right to celebrate as long and as hard as we want . " We sung the song out in the middle of the MCG just before they dug up the wicket. Hadds ( Brad Haddin ) wanted us to sing the song where he claims he took another hanger , so you just do as the songmaster tells you. ” The players walked around and spoke to the crowd , signed autographs , took selfies and some even broke into song. There was no one person who led the celebrations though. When Clarke was asked the question , all he could muster was : “ The whole squad is doing pretty well at the moment. ” All of Fed Square was swathed in green and gold. The Australians , they know how to celebrate . Share this article :
