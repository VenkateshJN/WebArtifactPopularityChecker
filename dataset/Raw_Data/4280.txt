Srinivasan decides to snap CSK ties The author has posted comments on this article TNN | Jan 25 , 2015 , 08.49AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 NEW DELHI : A cornered N Srinivasan has decided to disassociate himself from Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) following the Supreme Court 's ban on Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) office bearers having any commercial interests in the board 's activities . At a meeting of the board 's key functionaries on Saturday , Srinivasan apparently told BCCI members that he would keep himself out of the IPL team , sources told TOI. Srinivasan 's family has the majority stake in India Cements , which is the parent company of CSK. Srinivasan had earlier de-merged CSK from India Cements and made it a separate subsidiary in the hope that the court would give him an option to choose between a position in BCCI and his IPL franchise . Srinivasan is learned to have informed BCCI office bearers that he wants to be in the fray for the elections. N Srinivasan has decided to cut ties with IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings to concentrate on contesting the BCCI polls after the Supreme Court 's recent order. The court ruling clearly states that " a person can not contest the election till such time the person concerned holds commercial interest ( in the board ) or till the three-member panel ( probing charges of betting on IPL matches against CSK and Rajasthan Royals and their owners Gurunath Meiyappan and Raj Kundra ) considers and awards suitable punishment to those liable for the same , whichever is later. " This phrase " whichever is later " has closed all doors on Srinivasan as the elections have to be held within six weeks , while the three-member panel has been given six months to give its verdict .
