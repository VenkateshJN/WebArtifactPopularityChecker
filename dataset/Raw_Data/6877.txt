shares 60 Early diagnosis of his hamstring tweak suggests Dinesh Chandimal may be unavailable for three weeks © ICC Dinesh Chandimal will be monitored for 48 hours before a firm decision is taken on his further participation in the World Cup. However , early diagnosis of his hamstring tweak suggests he may be unavailable for three weeks , Sri Lanka 's team manager Michael de Zoysa has said . Chandimal tweaked a hamstring in his right thigh when attempting a tight second run in the 41st over of Sunday 's match against Australia . He immediately called for on-field treatment , but despite a rest and a rub-down , was significantly hampered by the injury . He stayed at the crease to complete his fifty , but was forced to retire hurt in the 42nd over , largely because he could only hobble between the wickets. His 52 not out off 24 balls - in his first World Cup innings - had done much to raise hopes of a successful Sri Lanka run chase. The chase petered out after his exit . Kusal Perera is on standby to enter the squad , having arrived in Australia and participated in training sessions with the squad , over the last week. He will only enter the squad after Chandimal is given every chance to recover , however. Sri Lanka play their next match against Scotland on Wednesday , but do not play another match for a week. If they qualify for the knockouts , they will play their quarter-final on March 18 , in Sydney . Chandimal is the fifth Sri Lanka player to sustain an injury during Sri Lanka 's campaign. Fast bowler Dhammika Prasad , slow-bowling allrounder Jeevan Mendis and batsman Dimuth Karunaratne have already been ruled out of the tournament , and Rangana Herath is still recovering from a cut to his spinning finger. Herath also remains doubtful for the match against Scotland . Andrew Fidel Fernando is ESPNcricinfo 's Sri Lanka correspondent. @ andrewffernando © ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
