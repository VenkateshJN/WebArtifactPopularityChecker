IPL 2013 : Spot fixing controversy ( Full Coverage ) Chennai Super Kings to be transferred to new subsidiary of India Cements 2015/Feb/06 07 : 37 : 00 Text Size CSK will now be owned by a subsidiary of India Cements , Chennai Super Kings Cricket Ltd. © BCCI Having been informed by the Supreme Court that he can not contest Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) elections until he gives up ownership of Indian Premier League ( IPL ) team Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) , N Srinivasan-led India Cements will now transfer CSK to a new subsidiary , Chennai Super Kings Cricket Ltd . In a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange ( BSE ) , India Cements said it has completed the required documentation for transfer of the Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) franchise to Chennai Super Kings Cricket Ltd. " The board will consider at the meeting on February 11 , 2015 reorganisation proposals relating to the said subsidiary , " it said . Earlier on September 26 , 2014 , the board of directors of the company had approved the proposal to demerge CSK into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company , by transferring its net assets at cost. It had also stated that the effective date of transfer will be January 1 , 2015 . Last month , a Supreme Court bench of Justice TS Thakur and Justice FMI Kalifulla had assailed the amendment in BCCI rules permitting cricket administrators , like Srinivasan , to have any commercial interest by owing teams in IPL and Champions League , and said it would be conflict of interest . The apex court had also directed that BCCI elections be held in six weeks " subject to the condition that no one who has any commercial interest in BCCI events ( including N Srinivasan ) shall be eligible for contesting the elections for any post whatsoever. " The rider in the judgement made it difficult for Srinivasan to become BCCI president , unless he quickly relinquished his interest in the CSK . © Cricbuzz ( with inputs from agencies ) More stories from IPL 2013 : Spot fixing controversy
