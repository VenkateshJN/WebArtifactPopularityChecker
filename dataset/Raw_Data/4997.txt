2014 - A year in review ( Full Coverage ) 2014 review : Test team of the year 2015/Jan/02 06 : 57 : 00 , by Jamie Alter Text Size Â© Cricbuzz David Warner ( M 9 , Inns 18 , Runs 1136 , Avg 63.11 , HS 145 , 100s 6 , 50s 3 ) Warners best year as a Test cricketer had a direct influence on the Australian teams success. By the time the fifth Test of the Ashes started in the first week of January , Warner had contributed 491 runs to a 4-0 scoreline , and a return of just 32 at the SCG did not herald a slump in the new year for the left-hand opener. In South Africa , Warner stamped his authority with 543 runs in six innings , with a century in the first Test , fifties in the second and 135 and 145 at Centurion to seal the series 2-1. Eight-and-a-half months later , in his first Test since those twin centuries , Warner scored arguably his most fluent innings , 133 off 174 balls against Pakistan in Dubai when the next best score of Australias first innings was 38 . When India came calling in December , Warner started the series with 145 and 102 at the MCG - twin hundreds for the second time in the year and which made a big impact on a 48-run win. He lost his touch thereafter , however , scoring 29 and 6 in Brisbane and 0 and 40 at the MCG , but that did little to take the shine off his value as the most fascinating and successful Test opener of 2014 . Murali Vijay ( M 10 , Inns 20 , Runs 852 , Avg 42.60 , HS 146 , 100s 2 , 50s 5 ) You wont find Vijays game in the top ten run-getters of the year. No , hes at 11th place. But hes been a constant for a sorry Indian team for two of three tours , showing a solidity that can hold him in good stead for future years . In England , his form in the first half of the five-Test series was directly proportionate to India being 1-0 after two Tests. Vijay began the series with 146 and 52 in the draw at Trent Bridge ; that century in the first innings was more than a third of Indias total and over two thirds of what Nos 1 to 8 managed. At Lords , Vijays second-innings 95 kept England at bay and proved pivotal to a famous win . The tour of Australia started in Adelaide where Vijay continued his affinity for Australian bowling attacks by making 53 and 99 , that second innings performance helping India take tea on 205/2 in pursuit of 364 on day five. Vijay got to three figures in the second match ( 144 ) , in the process becoming the first visiting opener to score a century on day one of a Gabba Test. In his final Test of the year , the right-hander added a patient 68 in the first innings at the MCG followed by a failure in the second. For his ability to dig deep in a team of shot-making young batsmen , and for standing up to Australia in Australia , Vijay is our second opener . Kane Williamson ( M 9 , Inns 17 , Runs 929 , Avg 61.93 , HS 192 , 100s 4 , 50s 2 ) Our selection for the No 3 spot in this list was between Williamson and Kumar Sangakkara , who was 2014s top run-getter with 1493 runs with four centuries and nine fifties , including 319 and 105 in one Test. But a closer inspection at Sangakkaras numbers showed that 1089 of his overall runs came in batting-friendly conditions in Asia , 499 of which were against Bangladesh , and with the cushion of having Mahela Jayawardene and Angelo Mathew to follow and the solidity of Kaushal Silva ahead of him. Sangakkara did wonderfully in England , scoring three fifties and a century in four innings of Sri Lankas maiden series win there , but Williamsons batting at No 3 in a team lacking toughness away from home , and his ability to influence results , tipped the balance in his favour . Williamson was in strong form in all formats of the game this year , but his most impactful performances came in Tests. Three innings in particular stand out : his 113 in the first innings of the Kingston Test , his 161 not out in the second at Bridgetown , and his 192 against Pakistan in Sharjah. At Sabina Park , Williamson walked in at 9/1 and his century helped build a strong platform from where the middle order powered the total to 508/7. New Zealand won by 186 runs . At Kensington Oval , Williamson followed a handy 43 in the first innings with 161 * in the second , the only score higher than 51 for the tourists. New Zealand won by 53 runs to take the series 2-1. In Sharjah last month , Williamsons 192 out of a second-wicket partnership of 297 with Brendon McCullum shoved Pakistan out of the match and helped NZ level the series. There was a fourth century for Williamson , in his first innings of 2014 , a polished 113 that helped New Zealand from 30/3 to 251/4 before he exited. And in his final match of 2014 , Williamson made 54 and 31 not out to seal New Zealands fifth win of the year , marking their best year in Test history . Younus Khan ( M 10 , Inns 20 , Runs 1213 , Avg 71.35 , HS 213 , 100s 6 , 50s 2 ) The veteran Pakistan batsmans resurgence in the latter of half 2014 needs perspective. In May , he hoped to revive his ODI career and retire on his own time rather than be dropped permanently. In August , he produced a superb 177 to help bail Pakistan out of trouble in Galle. In September , after being dropped from the ODI team to face Australia , Younus lashed out at PCB and selectors and said he was 'out of contention ' for the World Cup. Hurt by his snub , the 37-year-old challenged PCB to build the team without him. That emotional outburst over , he got down to doing the one thing that could boost his chances of selection : scoring runs. And a lot of them . The result was a stunning sequence of 106 , 103 * , 213 , 46 , 100 * , 28 , 72 and 44 in four Tests against Australia and New Zealand in the UAE. His twin centuries in Dubai played a big role in Pakistan taking a series lead over Australia and 213 in Abu Dhabi helped drive them to rare series win over that opposition - Pakistans first in two decades. Another century added to New Zealands woes in the first of three Tests in Abu Dhabi . His form tapered off... 5 and 0 in defeat to New Zealand in Sharjah , but Younis startling burst had taken him to second in the run list for 2014 and , more importantly , help fashion victories . Steven Smith ( M 9 , Inns 17 , Runs 1146 , Avg 81.85 , HS 192 , 100s 5 , 50s 4 ) That Smith , 25 , is the bedrock of Australias middle order barely 18 months since he returned to the Test squad is astonishing enough. When you consider his batting helped earn him the Test captaincy following Michael Clarkes latest injury , the real worth if Smiths contributions this year comes forward . The ease and confidence with which Smith scored hundreds at the SCG , Centurion , Adelaide Oval , the Gabba and the MCG were eye-catching. His 84 and 36 * not in the huge win in Cape Town were sparkling innings ; scores of 55 and 97 in the UAE were further testament that he can play spin the best and shun his natural ways to eat up sessions. His 162 * and 52 * were big factors in a 48-run win over India in Adelaide , while that 133 in Hobart was as match-winning an inning as they come these days. And then , a Boxing Day Test special - 192 out of Australias 530 . Angelo Mathews ( capt ) ( M 12 , Inns 21 , Runs 1317 , HS 160 , 100s 3 , 50s 8 , W 10 ) Did any Asian cricketer grow more in 2014 than Mathews ? Handed the captaincy in the second half of 2013 , the Sri Lankan allrounder was hugely instrumental in the teams success this year. Time and again he was there in the middle order to either bail Sri Lanka out of trouble or build on platforms. Against Pakistan in Sharjah in January , Mathews scored 91 to shore up a poor collective failure from the top five to set the tone for a productive year. At Lords , his 102 turned a position of control into one of dominance. And then came Leeds , where his second-innings 160 drove Sri Lanka into a position from where they went on to claim the series . Against South Africa at home : 89 , 27 * , 63 and 63 * . Against Pakistan at home : 91 , 25 * , 39 and 43 * . The score that really mattered was that unbeaten 25 off 13 balls in Galle , shoving Sri Lanka in a chase of 99 with under five overs remaining. During the day one carnage against New Zealand at Hagley Oval , Mathews was Sri Lankas stand-out bowler with 3/39 from 12 overs and then made 50 out of a total of 138 when the next best was 24 . Equally skilled at numbing the opposition with a dead bat or batting with flair , Mathews was consistence personified in 2014. His bowling too was handy , with 4/60 at Leeds proving mighty handy . Safraz Ahmed ( wk ) ( M 9 , Inns 16 , Runs 743 , Avg 67.54 , HS 112 , 100s 3 , 50s 4 , C 11 , St 7 ) The most successful wicketkeeper-batsman in terms of runs scored in 2014 was also one of the years more poignant stories. Sarfraz , 27 , returned to Pakistan 's Test line-up in against Sri Lanka in January after the selectors once again dumped the Akmal brothers , and did not look back. He started with 7 and 74 in that Dubai defeat and remained a thorn in Sri Lankas side , scoring 55 , 52 * , 103 and 55 in four innings in the return series. Centuries followed against Australia - 109 off 105 balls - and New Zealand - 112 off 195 balls - in contrasting situations . Sarfrazs batting was critical to Pakistans revolution as a team in 2014 and what stood out was his ability to dig deep as well as change sessions by attacking. His maiden century at the SSC contained shots not out of place in ODI cricket , and lifted Pakistan from 140/5 to 315/9. His 55 in the second innings was the only score above 32. And , crucially , Safraz proved he could bat with the tail. His glovework was overall tidy , with some swift dismissals mixed with some regulation fumbles. Overall , for his sudden impact and reliability , Sarfraz is our designated wicketkeeper . Mitchell Johnson ( M 9 , W 47 , Avg 27.45 , SR 44.2 , 5-fer 2 , 10-fer 1 ) The second highest wicket-taker of 2014. From Sydney to Melbourne , Johnson ran in and gave it all , the conditions and opposition be damned. He wanted to bowl flat out and did. Until Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane countered him with some superb batting in the Boxing Day Test , no bowler put fear in opposing teams more than moustachioed Mitch and , barring two Tests against Pakistan in the UAE where the surfaces dulled his threat , the left-arm quick was almost the complete package . A Johnson yorker that bowled Test opener Chris Rogers in an intra-squad practice match in Johannesburg moved Australia 's bowling coach , Craig McDermott , to predict that the left-arm fast bowler would bowl better in South Africa than he had in the 5-0 Ashes drubbing of England. Less than five days later , McDermott 's words rang true after Johnson devastated South Africa at Centurion with a match-winning haul of 12/127 to leave the hosts hurt and Australia 1-0 up. Johnson added ten more in the next two Tests to help Australia take the series . After the tougher outing in the UAE , Johnson returned home and played a role in Australia taking the series against India before the New Year , most crucially with a lively fourth morning burst swinging the game the home teams way for good. This after he game-changing 88 off 93 balls the day before . Rangana Herath ( M 10 , W 60 , Avg 27.45 , SR 61 , BBI 9/127 , 5-fer 5 , 10-fer 1 ) The leading Test wicket-taker in 2014 , the Sri Lankan left-arm spinner was instrumental to his teams success with 34 of his 60 wickets coming in five wins. Herath took 14 wickets in Sri Lankas 1-1 draw against Pakistan in the UAE in January ; eight in two Tests in England followed ; then 12 at home in a 1-0 loss to South Africa , nine alone at the SSC as the hosts nearly drew level. Heaths figures in the final innings were a mind-boggling 45-30-40-5. But what he produced at home against Pakistan was outstanding : 23 wickets in two Tests , with 14 coming in a series-clinching win at the SSC . Of his 60 wickets , 13 were top-order batsmen and 25 middle-order batsmen. The next most successful spinner in 2014 was Sri Lankas team-mate Dilruwan Perera , with 36. The gulf was that vast. This was , incidentally , the second time that Herath took 60 wickets in a calendar year , after 2012 . Dale Steyn ( M 8 , W 39 , Avg 19.56 , SR 37.6 , BBI 6/34 , 5-fer 3 ) The lowest average and strike-rate of the year , for any bowler playing more than one Test , speaks volumes of Steyns potency. At home against Australia , Steyn was a considerable second to Johnson in the fast-bowling duel but his match-winning spell of 3 for 10 on the fourth day at Port Elizabeth was pure adrenalin-fuelled mastery . Then came Galle , where he claimed the best figures by a seamer at the venue ( 9 for 99 ) - an achievement made better by the expectation that Sri Lankan conditions would not suit him. I owe it to [ Allan ] Donald , said Steyn after his nine-wicket haul bowled South Africa to only their third win on Sri Lankan soil. And like the mentor he spoke of , Steyns bowling in Galle was reminiscent of Donald in his prime : it was a display of pace and purpose . Zimbabwe were no match for Steyn in a one-off Test , not surprisingly , that yielded eight wickets , and before the year was up the 31-year-old knocked West Indies over with 6 for 34 in their second innings at Centurion. And to show he was more than a mean fast bowler , Steyn slugged the quickest Test fifty at St Georges Park - off 26 balls . James Anderson ( M 8 , W 40 , Avg 22.15 , Econ 2.68 , SR 49.5 , 5-fer 1 ) Not the England fast bowlers most profitable year , but 40 wickets in eight Tests , seven of which spanned three months , is a very fine return ( and only three bowlers took more wickets in 2014 ) . Anderson started well against Sri Lanka , with figures of 19-10-25-4 in the final innings of an epic Lords draw setting the tone for a successful summer. In five Tests against India , Anderson took 25 wickets at 20.60 to finish the series most successful bowler and now stands three wickets behind Ian Botham to become England 's leading wicket-taker. This , after he went past Fred Trueman as Englands most successful bowler at home . " Its right up there... it 's the best I 've probably bowled , " said Anderson after being named Man of the Series . Tellingly , Anderson was the player to emerge stronger from the pushgate episode against Ravindra Jadeja. A day after a rather sedate verdict was handed out , he combined with Stuart Broad to wreck India on a lively Old Trafford deck as India slumped to 8/4 - their third worst start in Test history. There was also a special contribution with the bat : a career-best 81 off 130 balls in a Test record partnership of 198 for the tenth wicket with Joe Root . Â© Cricbuzz
