Jayasuriya quits as Sri Lanka selection chief 2015/Apr/03 03 : 22 : 00 Text Size Media reports say Sri Lanka Cricket 's new interim committee was n't in favour of extending Jayasuriya 's tenure as selection chief. © AFP A revamp in Sri Lanka Cricket 's leadership with a new interim committee led by former cricketer Sidath Wettimuny taking over has resulted in the resignation of the selection panel headed by Sanath Jayasuriya , according to media reports . Jayasuriya was appointed the chairman of selectors in June 2013 and the selection committee 's tenure was to end on March 31 , but a postponement of the Sri Lanka Cricket elections due to the World Cup had extended their stay by another month , but a report in PTI says the new administration was n't in favour of extending their tenure . Jayasuriya tendered his resignation to sports minister Navin Dissanayake. " I am extremely proud and happy that during my tenure Sri Lanka was able to emerge world champions in T20 , win the Asia Cup and a long awaited series against England , " PTI quoted him. " I am always available if Sri Lanka Cricket needs me to serve the country in the future. " The new interim committee took charge on April 1 after the previous one , chaired by Jayantha Dharmadasa was fired by the sports minister. Jayasuriya 's position came under criticism after Sri Lanka 's defeat to South Africa in the quarter-finals of the World Cup , where they had picked the inexperienced Dushmantha Chameera and debutant Tharindu Kaushal . © Cricbuzz ( with inputs from agencies )
