Pepsi ICC World Cricket League ( WCL ) Division 2 will take place from 17 to 24 January in Windhoek , Namibia. Canada , Kenya , Nepal , Netherlands , Uganda and host Namibia will lock horns in the eight-day tournament across three grounds , Wanderers , Wanderers Affies and United , with the tournament final to be played at Wanderers on Saturday , 24 January. The top two teams have the opportunity to progress to the ICC ’ s four-day , first class competition for Associate and Affiliate Members , the ICC Intercontinental Cup 2015-17 , as well as the 50-over Pepsi ICC World Cricket League Championship . The Pepsi ICC Development Programme – which commenced in 1997 – plays an important role in the growth and improvement of cricket in ICC ’ s Associate and Affiliate Members ( AMs ) . The Development Programme oversees all qualification structures into ICC ’ s major events. The WCL is a critical part of this process , providing AMs a pathway to play in the ICC Cricket World Cup since 2007. The WCL provides the pathway into the ICC ’ s four-day , first class competition for AMs , the ICC Intercontinental Cup. Following the recent decision of the ICC Board to “ break the glass ceiling ” and allow the winner of the ICC Intercontinental Cup the opportunity to qualify to play Test cricket , the WCL has taken on even greater significance. Such international event pathways complement the ICC ’ s ongoing development work that aims to improve all facets of the game in AMs , including facilities , coaching , administration , education and domestic competitions .
