0 ( 1w ) 10.2 to Krishna Chandran , 95.9 kph , given ! Ashwin dangles this slow outside off , entices Krishnan forward to defend. It dips and bounces and that hits his glove , on to thigh pad , and a simple catch to leg slip 28/3 14.5 to Patil , 93.0 kph , arm-ball does the trick ! Seam pointing towards slip , and it 's to that fielder that Patil edges it as he presses forward to defend. Swings away late , and Dhawan takes an excellent catch , diving to his right 41/4 16.4 to Khurram Khan , 85.0 kph , and that 's number three for Ashwin. Picks the wrong length to sweep on a pitch with this much bounce , gloves it in the air over Dhoni , and Raina moved quickly to his right from slip towards a leg-slip-ish position to take a dolly 44/5 22.3 to Mohammad Naveed , 104.8 kph , gets him with a quicker one and that 's four for Ashwin , first time in an ODI. Made room even before the bowler was into his final stride , and he fired a quick arm ball on middle and leg. Too quick for Naveed to cut 68/8
