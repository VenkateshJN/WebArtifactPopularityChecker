Loading comments MasterClass on January 18 , 2015 , 2 : 09 GMT AUS & SA are clear favourites. NZ is the dark horse and everyones 2nd choice , it may just be their time ! Would n't that be something ! I 'd like IND to be there but ca n't say I see it happening. ENG , WI do n't have their act together yet and along with IND will be in the middle of the pack. SL & PAK are the least likely among the majors and will bring up the rear . on January 16 , 2015 , 23 : 33 GMT In terms of batting , I think the top teams are : SA , Ind and Aus , not necessarily in that order. The bottom teams ( among the 10 Test nations ) are WI , Zim and BD . In terms of bowling , the top teams are probably Aus , SA and NZ , while the bottom teams are Ind , Zim and BD . jokerbala on January 16 , 2015 , 20 : 29 GMT Watch out for Newzealand and West Indies . I feel they will turn the tables on the others this world cup . bigscore215 on January 16 , 2015 , 19 : 58 GMT I think the World cup will be won among the following 4 . 1. Australia 2. SouthAfrica 3. SriLanka 4. Newzealand I feel Australia or Srilanka most likely . Newzealand may reach final most likely . Southafric definitely will reach semifinal on January 16 , 2015 , 16 : 17 GMT for me the 4 semifinalists will be Australia , South Africa , New Zealand and England. Sri Lanka India West Indies n Pakistan all under dogs Humdingers on January 16 , 2015 , 13 : 51 GMT Top 4 ( Semis ) : Australia ; SA ; India and WI ( or NZ ) . on January 16 , 2015 , 12 : 41 GMT LOVELY SHOW ! ! i can smell it before even watchin it : ) GREATS of the Game in Gaeme and Rahul and a lead into who they believe are the hot teams of the World Cup and the underdogs.
