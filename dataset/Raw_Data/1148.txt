He brings in Shaminda Eranga . 1330 ( IST ) : India off to a good start with three boundaries coming from Ajinkya Rahane 's bat in the first over. He is in the middle with Rohit who is a bit cautious compared to his partner. Meanwhile , this is what happened just before the toss : Angelo Matthews ( L ) and Virat Kohli cut a cake to mark Eden Gardens ' 150th year . © BCCI 13 : 00 ( IST ) : Toss time : Virat Kohli has won and he chooses to bat first. India have made three changes. Rohit Sharma is in for Shikhar Dhawan , Karn Sharma for Ravichandran Ashwin. Also , Stuart Binny replaces the injured Ishant Sharma. Sri Lanka have made four changes , all the new guys brought into the squad are in the eleven while Sangakkara has been rested. Kohli says he opted to bat since the ball might do something later on under the lights. Mathews says he would have liked to bat first too on the Eden Gardens track . India have done very well in ODIs under Virat Kohli 's captaincy . © PTI PREVIEW Both India and Sri Lanka will go in with new teams and different aspirations. Robin Uthappa , who came in for wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha , and Rohit Sharma , who replaced the series ' top scorer Shikhar Dhawan , will bolster the batting as Virat Kohli 's team aims to whitewash the Lankans for the first time since 1982. All-rounder Stuart Binny will also fancy his chances . The Sri Lankans have looked all at sea. They have played far below potential with skipper Angelo Mathews being the lone ranger. Veteran star Mahela Jayawardene slammed a century in Motera but the effort went in vain. The former captain could open the innings as Sri Lanka look for more consistency at the top of the order . Sri Lanka have brought in fresh legs for the remaining two ODIs vs India . © PTI The experimenting Sri Lankans have brought in fresh legs. The inspirational Kumar Sangakkara strangely lacked intent in this series and was rightly sent home along with three others. The Lankan middle-order will be bolstered by Dinesh Chandimal and Lahiru Thirimanne. The bowling should see the return of Ajantha Mendis and Shaminda Eranga. Mystery offie Mendis has played more matches ( 17 ) and taken more wickets ( 32 ) against India , than against any other opposition . Kohli is having a good time with the bat and as stand-in skipper. He will be happy to see the return of Rohit Sharma , who he reckons as India 's X-factor in the World Cup next year . " Captaincy gives me an opportunity to actually open up my vision and the ideas I have , and actually implement them on the field. I strongly believe in whatever I do on the field , and that 's why more often than not , we 're able to execute those plans , " said Kohli in Kolkata on Wednesday . These are brave words from a young captain who loves to lead by example. The immediate future in Australia will reveal his real ability .
