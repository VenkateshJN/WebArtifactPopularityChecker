Broad misses hat-trick for England against Australia The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Feb 14 , 2015 , 11.24AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 MELBOURNE : Stuart Broad struck a massive blow for England with the wicket of Australian batsmen David Warner and Shane Watson with consecutive balls in the World Cup opener on Saturday . Just when skipper Eoin Morgan 's decision to send the Aussies into bat looked it may backfire , the giant Broad stepped up to rock the home side . He bowled the dangerous Warner for 22 and then with the next ball in his fourth over had Watson caught behind for a duck . Australia , who had breezed on a 50-run opening stand off just 37 balls , were rocking at 57 for two in the eighth over . Steve Smith , however , kept out the hat-trick ball by digging out a Broad yorker . Chris Woakes put down a sharp chance at mid-wicket before Aaron Finch had scored in James Anderson 's opening over and the little opener profited to be 33 off 27 balls .
