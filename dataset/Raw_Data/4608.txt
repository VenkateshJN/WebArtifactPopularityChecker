The Event Technical Committee of the tournament approved the replacement . Milne felt discomfort in his left heel following the quarter-final against the West Indies on Sunday and subsequently underwent an MRI scan on Sunday afternoon . The results showed significant swelling around the region rendering him unfit to play any further part in the tournament . Henry , the 23-year-old Christchurch born fast bowler , has played eight One-Day Internationals and two T20 internationals for New Zealand to date . Any injury or illness-based replacement requires a written submission to the Event Technical Committee along with a diagnosis from a medical practitioner as to the extent of the injury or illness . Once replaced , a player may not return to the squad save as an approved subsequent replacement for another injured or ill player . New Zealand will take on South Africa in the first semi-final of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 at Eden Park on Tuesday .
