Criticism of Indian bowlers justified : Anil Kumble The author has posted comments on this article IANS | Jan 12 , 2015 , 06.25PM IST Anil Kumble said India possess quality bowlers who can bowl the opposition out twice in overseas conditions in Tests. ( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 BENGALURU : Former cricket captain Anil Kumble has said the heavy criticism of the Indian bowling after the just-concluded Test series loss against Australia was justified . Kumble said India possess quality bowlers who can bowl the opposition out twice in overseas conditions in Tests but their progress has to be monitored regularly to maximize their potential . " Some portion of the criticism is justified. We have the quality of bowlers , it 's just trying to see who can adjust to the Test format and then choosing your best four bowlers who you think can pick up 20 wickets , that 's also been an issue , " Kumble said on Monday . He also said the combination of bowlers should be chosen once you assess the condition and the pitch , and then select the best possible outfit who can take 20 wickets . " We have gone into this theory of three seamers and one spinner the moment we sit on an aircraft which travels more than seven hours - that 's the mindset. If your 20 wickets are going to come with two spinners and two fast bowlers , so be it. If it comes with three spinners and one fast bowler so be it , " the 44-year-old said . He cited the example of the team selected for the first Test in Adelaide , where on a strip known to help spinners , Indians only fielded debutant tweaker Karn Sharma . Kumble asked : " So who got wickets for Australia then ? If you look at the top two bowlers , it was one spinner and one fast bowler.
