Dinesh Karthik contributed 36 off 22 balls but Quinton de Kock ( 10 ) , Murali Vijay ( 20 ) and Kevin Pietersen ( 6 ) once again failed to get going . Sunil Narine could not have the same impact as his previous performances and conceded 38 runs in his four overs , picking up the sole wicket of Laxmi Ratan Shukla . Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan was the pick of the bowlers with figures of one for 13 in four overs . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Kolkata Knight Riders,Kedhar Jadhav,JP Duminy,IPL 7,Delhi Daredevils Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
