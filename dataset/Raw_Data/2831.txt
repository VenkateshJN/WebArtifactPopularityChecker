Ramsey set for Arsenal return at QPR The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Mar 3 , 2015 , 05.34PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 LONDON : Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey is in line to make his return from a hamstring problem in Wednesday 's Premier League clash with Queens Park Rangers , manager Arsene Wenger revealed on Tuesday . The Wales international sustained a third hamstring injury of the season during Arsenal 's 2-1 defeat of Leicester City on February 10 , but is in contention to feature at Loftus Road after returning to training ahead of schedule . " Aaron Ramsey is back in the squad , " Wenger told a press conference. " When you have a repetition of muscular injuries , it can put the handbrake on your body a little bit. To get rid of that is a psychological problem . " I do n't think he suffers from that , looking at him in training. Certainly , you lose a bit of confidence in your body. " Ramsey 's fellow midfielder Jack Wilshere remains sidelined after undergoing surgery on his troublesome ankle and will not play against QPR or in Monday 's FA Cup quarterfinal at Manchester United . " He is doing well , " Wenger said of Wilshere. " It takes some time to heal the wound after the surgery. It will take his a few days. I do n't set any dates , but what is for sure is that for Man United he will not be available. " Wenger is also hoping that Francis Coquelin will be able to play against QPR despite fracturing his nose during Sunday 's 2-0 win over Everton , with the French midfielder set to wear a protective mask .
