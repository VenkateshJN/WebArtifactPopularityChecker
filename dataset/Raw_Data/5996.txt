That is the word used extensively to describe the batting style of Sir Vivian Richards. Aggressive batting was not a very common sight in the 1970s and 80s , but the term aggression is an understatement when it comes to describing Viv â   s batting. Devastating would be a better term. With just a cap on ( he never wore a helmet ) , he would slowly walk into the crease accompanied by huge cheers from the crowd , who demanded nothing sort of entertainment from him. Entertain he did , and poor bowlers from across the globe were reduced to mere bowling machines and the fielders to ball-boys who would run to the fence and fetch the ball . But Viv Richards was not a slogger. 8000 + Test runs at a 50 + average with 24 centuries can not possibly come from mere slogging. Add to that the 5 centuries he made in World Series cricket , and Richards will comfortably fall into one of the all-time best Test batsmen. He made his Test debut in 1974 in India , and scored an unbeaten 192 in his very second game. Just 2 years later , in 1976 , Richards scored 1710 runs at an average of 90 with 7 centuries from 11 Tests. It remained a record for almost 30 years , until it was broken by Mohammad Yousuf in 2006. He also scored the fastest ever Test century , when he smashed a ton in just 56 balls against England in 1986 . In ODIs , Richards had a strike rate of 90 + when he retired , a feat which wasn â   t too easy in those days. He was part of the World Cup winning West Indies sides of 1975 and 79 , and even scored a century in the latter edition 's final to help his side to the title . The name Viv Richards is often associated with his destructive batting style ( and rightly so ) , but not many remember him as one of the best captains for West Indies. In the period between 1984 and 1991 , when he was the captain for 50 Tests , West Indies never lost even a single series. He was also widely respected for refusing a blank-cheque offer to play for the rebel West Indies tour to South Africa during the Apartheid period in 1983-84 . Richards also played County cricket in England for the Somerset team. He is one of the 4 non English batsmen to make 100 first class centuries. In 2000 , he was named as one of the 5 Wisden Cricketers of the Century . Interesting facts : Richards also played international football for Antigua , having represented them in the qualifying matches for the 1974 World Cup In 1994 , he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) for services to cricket [ Source : Wikipedia ] Richards had a brief affair with Indian actress , Neena Gupta and fathered a child - named Masaba . The Sir Vivian Richards Stadium is a cricket stadium in North Sound , Antigua , Antigua and Barbuda , which is named in honour after him. It was built for use in the 2007 Cricket World Cup [ Source : Wikipedia ] His son , Mali also took to cricket like a fish to water but has very little to show for when compared to the stellar feats of his father. Mali , a left handed batsman , has represented Middlesex and Leeward Islands . By Karthik Lakshmanan
