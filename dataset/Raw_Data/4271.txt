Sri Lanka 's Rangana Herath out of World Cup The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Mar 18 , 2015 , 11.52AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 SYDNEY : Sri Lanka spinner Rangana Herath has been ruled out of the remainder of the World Cup and will not feature in Wednesday 's quarterfinal against South Africa in Sydney , the International Cricket Council announced . Herath needed four stitches in the spinning finger of his left hand after he tried to stop a full-blooded drive from England 's Jos Buttler during Sri Lanka 's nine-wicket win in Wellington on March 1 and has n't played since . " Because he has not trained properly for 16 days , and is still unfit , he has been ruled out of further participation in the tournament , " a statement issued on behalf of the ICC 's event technical committee said . Herath has been replaced by off-spinner Tharindu Kaushal . Prior to Sri Lanka 's practice session at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday , captain Angelo Mathews rated Herath 's chances of playing on Wednesday at just " fifty-fifty " and the odds against him taking part looked even longer when he managed just five balls in the nets . The 22-year-old Kaushal has yet to play a one-day international with his solitary Test appearance coming against New Zealand in Wellington in December last year . Should Sri Lanka , the 1996 champions and runners-up at the last two World Cups , decide against giving Kaushal an ODI debut in such a high-profile match , they do have slow bowling alternatives in the off-spin of Tillakaratne Dilshan , primarily a batsman , leg-break bowler Seekkuge Prasanna and off-spinner Sachithra Senanayake . Sri Lanka have suffered a series of injuries at the World Cup with all-rounder Jeevan Mendis and batsmen Dimuth Karunaratne and Dinesh Chandimal all forced to drop out of the squad .
