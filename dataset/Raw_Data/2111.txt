( PTI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 JAIPUR : Mehmood Abdi , Rajasthan Cricket Association 's authorized representative at the BCCI , said on Tuesday that the Supreme Court order on India Cements has effectively barred N Srinivasan from attending ICC meetings . " The Supreme Court has clearly said that employees of India Cements should be kept away from BCCI 's activities , " Abdi said . " Srinivasan is an employee of India Cements and therefore , can not represent the BCCI at ICC meetings , " Abdi said . " Removal of smaller functionaries of India Cements from various BCCI assignments would not be the desired compliance of the Supreme Court Order until N Srinivasan is removed from all BCCI assignments and responsibilities including representation at the ICC , " Abdi added in a statement . As per the Supreme Court 's directives , all India Cements employees have been asked to relinquish positions that they were holding with the BCCI . That includes MA Satheesh , who was Team India 's logistics manager in the ongoing T20 World Cup in Bangladesh . Abdi contended that the same rule should apply to Srinivasan. The lawyer added that the BCCI 's interim president should clarify this position , since an impression is being created that Srinivasan can continue to represent the body at the ICC .
