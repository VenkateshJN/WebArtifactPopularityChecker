Irfan was ruled out of the World Cup due to a stress fracture to his pelvis. Speaking to the Express News , Shaharyar said no replacement will be sent for the quarter-final as the match would be over when the replacement reaches Adelaide . He added that the choice of the replacement would be up to the team management. " If Pakistan proceeds to the semi-final , then a replacement will be sent and it could be Ajmal. It could also be Junaid Khan. When Junaid and Mohammad Hafeez had got injured , I had suggested that Ajmal should be sent as a replacement but the tour selection committee wanted a fast bowler and an opener as replacement , " he added . Ajmal 's action was declared illegal and he was suspended from bowling in September 2014 but his action was cleared by the ICC on February 07. Before Irfan 's injury , former Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akram had told AFP that he had to work hard on his fitness. " Irfan is different. His body stretches more and needs careful handling , " Wasim said . © Cricbuzz ( with inputs from agencies ) Tags
