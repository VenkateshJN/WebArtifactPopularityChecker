Irani Cup : Karnataka reel under Aaron burst The author has posted comments on this article Vedam Jaishankar , TNN | Mar 18 , 2015 , 11.26AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 BENGALURU : Right through the season it was the sting in the Karnataka tail that opponents were wary of. But that was not to be on Tuesday. Uncharacteristically , the lower order meekly toppled over for Rest of India to take the honours on the opening day of the Irani Cup tussle at the M Chinaswamy Stadium on Tuesday . India fast bowler Varun Aaron , relishing the opportunity of bowling on a fresh pitch , came up with incisive spells that brooked no answer from the Karnataka line-up. His haul of six for 63 flattened the home team from a promising score of 220 for four to a below average total of 244. By stumps Rest of India had moved to 20 for the loss of one wicket . Put in to bat first on a pitch that had some moisture and plenty of help for the pacemen early on , Karnataka rode through the first session reasonably well despite losing opener Robin Uthappa ( 10 ) and one-drop R Samarth ( 20 ) . Aaron , who was used as a first change bowler to allow swing bowler Rishi Dhawan to have a shot with the new ball , accounted for Uthappa in his very first over. However a few flaws and focus on key areas. Karnataka , perhaps , would have wished that he had not tweaked his bowling to the extent that he looked a notch superior to his teammates . Put in to bat first on a pitch that had some moisture and plenty of help for the pacemen early on , Karnataka rode wickets for 90 runs. Mayank Agarwal , returning to the team after a long absence , came up with some handsome drives to top score with 68 ( 174m , 119b , 13x4 ) . But the post-lunch session was a shocker for Karnataka. They lost two quick wickets and it was only a fortuitous 54 from debutant Abhishek Reddy ( who replaced injured Shishir Bhawane ) and his 113-run fifth-wicket partnership with the more solid Karun Nair ( 59 ; 143m , 99b , 11x4 ) that saved the day for the home team .
