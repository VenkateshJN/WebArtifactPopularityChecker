Miffed Pietersen takes a dig at Gooch 2015/Apr/06 06 : 34 : 00 Text Size Pietersen recently pulled out of the Indian Premier League and joined Surrey. © Getty Kevin Pietersen has strongly reacted to former captain Graham Gooch 's comments that England could put to an end to the talk of his return if they beat West Indies in the three Test series starting in a few days ' time . In a bid to revive his international career , the 34-year-old Pietersen recently pulled out of the Indian Premier League and joined Surrey , acting on the advice of incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves . However , Gooch 's comments on Sunday could harm Pietersen 's chances a great deal. " He is box office and still good enough - it is whether he has the will and appetite to go to these places and turn it on for Surrey. Ever since he was disposed of by England , I think him and his media team have wiped the floor with the ECB. He has won the media PR battle , his name is up in lights and he is looked at as the saviour of English cricket , " Gooch told BBC Radio 5 live 's Sportsweek programme . " We need to get our cricket right. Cook needs to lead from the front - he has had three months off and is refreshed and has been working hard. It is a great media story to get Kevin back in , but I think if he does n't get a call-up , he will be off to the Caribbean Premier League mid-summer , " Gooch , who was replaced as England 's batting coach by Mark Ramprakash last year , added . In reply to these comments , Pietersen , who was put out to pasture by the ECB in the wake of a 5-0 Ashes whitewash last year , took to Twitter and took a dig at the 61-year-old. Read the tweet below . Graham Gooch - you captained a rebel tour of SA , got banned & then returned to the England team. I do n't think I 've done anything as bad ! — Kevin Pietersen ( @ KP24 ) April 5 , 2015 © Cricbuzz
