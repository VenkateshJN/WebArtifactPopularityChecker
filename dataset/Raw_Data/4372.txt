Tri-series 4th ODI : Bell smashes career-best 141 as England post 303/8 The author has posted comments on this article Reuters | Jan 23 , 2015 , 01.37PM IST England 's Ian Bell acknowledges the crowd after he scored a century during the ODI match against Australia at Bellerive Oval in Hobart. ( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 Ian Bell smashed a career-best 141 to power England to a strong 303 for eight wickets in the one-day international tri-series against Australia at Hobart on Friday . Put in to bat by Australia 's stand-in captain Steven Smith , Bell and Moeen Ali ( 46 ) added 113 for the opening wicket to give England a rollicking start . An aggressive Bell , who hit 15 fours and one six in his 125-ball innings , appeared in good touch and took a firm step towards securing the opener 's role for the Feb. 19-March 29 World Cup ahead of Alex Hales . He timed the ball sweetly and was not afraid to hit the ball over the in-field , reaching his half-century in 42 balls and then the three-figure mark in 92 balls with a pulled single off paceman Pat Cummins . Cummins was punished by Moeen early on when the left-hander pulled the bowler for three consecutive sixes . Bell also added 121 for the third wicket with Joe Root ( 69 ) but medium pacer Gurinder Sandhu pulled things back a bit for Australia by dismissing the centurion and England captain Eoin Morgan for a golden duck in three balls . England could have posted a bigger total but lost six wickets in the last nine overs , including three in the last three deliveries of their innings , that yielded 51 runs .
