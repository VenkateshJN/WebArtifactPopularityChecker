October 31 down the years Hit the ground running The man who made a century and a double in his first three Tests shares 1976 At 19 years , 141 days , Javed Miandad became the youngest person to make a Test double-century. He cracked 206 in only his third Test - he 'd already made 163 in his first - as Pakistan racked up 565 for 9 in their first innings in Karachi . It looked more than enough when New Zealand fell to 195 for 6 , but Warren Lees ( 152 ) and Richard Hadlee ( 81 ) added a then national-record 186 for the seventh wicket to ward off the follow-on , and a draw was a formality after that. In all , 1585 runs were scored for the loss of 31 wickets . 1990 Hurricane Waqar blew away New Zealand in Faisalabad to seal a 3-0 clean sweep for Pakistan. It was a remarkable match. Pakistan were bowled out for 102 on the first morning , with Chris Pringle - who later admitted to tampering with the ball because he was sure Pakistan were doing it - taking 7 for 52. New Zealand managed a first-innings lead of 115 , thanks mainly to a savage 42-ball 62 from Ian Smith , but Shoaib Mohammad made his third hundred of the series and Waqar Younis added 5 for 54 to his first-innings 7 for 76 as Pakistan won by 65 runs. Before the series he was a virtual unknown who had played only five Tests , but with 29 wickets at 10.86 in the three matches , Waqar had well and truly arrived . 1895 Birth of India 's first Test captain. Colonel Cottari " CK " Nayudu was an upright batsman , an especially fine driver who gave the ball a fearful thump , and a very handy slow-medium bowler. He was 36 when India took their bow and so played only seven Tests in all. His best innings was his last , at The Oval in 1936 , when he refused to retire hurt despite a painful blow to the solar plexus from Gubby Allen , and made a patient 81 to avert an innings defeat. He played first-class cricket in six decades , from 1916 to 1963 ( at the age of 68 ) , before dying in Indore in 1967 . 1987 The first World Cup hat-trick. Chetan Sharma bowled Ken Rutherford , Ian Smith and Ewen Chatfield with the last three balls of his sixth over as India hammered New Zealand by nine wickets in Nagpur . In order to top the group ahead of Australia and secure a home semi-final , India had to reach their target of 222 in 42.2 overs. They did so in 32.1 , courtesy of what the Wisden Almanack described as " batting of breathtaking brilliance " . Kris Srikkanth smashed 75 off 58 balls , but the surprise package was at the other end , where Sunil Gavaskar matched him stroke for stroke , thrashing his only one-day hundred in 108 appearances , off just 85 balls . 1887 Birth of the Test player known as " Dodger " . William Whysall , who played four Tests for England , was thus nicknamed , but there was little artful about his batting. He was a largely defensive batsman , usually at the top of the order , with huge powers of concentration. He made more than 20,000 first-class runs for Nottinghamshire and shared in 40 century opening stands with George Gunn. He did n't do too much wrong for England , making a couple of seventies in his first two Tests , in Adelaide and Melbourne in 1924-25. He contracted septicaemia after falling on a dance floor in Nottingham and died shortly afterwards , aged only 43 . 1984 The second one-dayer between Pakistan and India in Sialkot was abandoned as news came through of the assassination of Indira Gandhi , the Indian prime minister. The remainder of the tour - another one-dayer and a Test - was cancelled. At the same time England arrived in New Delhi for a five-Test tour which was almost aborted when , four weeks later , the British deputy high commissioner of Western India , Percy Norris , was shot dead the morning after hosting a reception for the tour party .
