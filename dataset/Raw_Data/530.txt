Do n't attribute it to a person who is not represented here.

He added that there was a suggestion in this regard from Arun Jaitley , who was of the view that there should not be interference by the Board into the probe .

" Who was at the helm of the working committee meeting ? Who was heading the meeting ? , " the bench asked when Sibal was making the submissions . The court also asked the BCCI to submit a note on the financial model of the Indian Premier League ; as to how players are purchased and how franchises recover their money. The hearing will resume on December 8 when Srinivasan 's lawyer Sibal is expected to make further arguments on the conflict of interest issue .
