Â© PTI Adelaide : Virat Kohli said Monday he will lead India in the opening Test against Australia in place of the injured Mahendra Singh Dhoni and urged his players to adopt a positive mindset. ( Australia ready to inflict pain on India : Shane Watson ) There had been speculation that regular skipper Dhoni would resume the captaincy for Tuesday 's Adelaide Test after his late arrival in Australia as he recovers from a fractured thumb. ( India need tough minds in Australia : Geoff Lawson ) But Kohli confirmed at the Adelaide Oval that he would take charge of the first of four Tests , determined to expunge the memories of India 's humiliating series loss this year in England. ( Shikhar Dhawan ready for Mitchell Johnson challenge ) " Yes , I will be leading India tomorrow , " Kohli said. ( Pujara keen to learn from failures , ready for Australia ) " We have plans in mind , we have plans we want to achieve. We have come here with a mindset of winning the series rather than going out there and seeing what happens , that is not an option. ( Australia to wear No. 408 as tribute to Phillip Hughes ) " The guys are on the same page , responding nicely and the guys are comfortable , they feel happy with what we want from them , definitely should be an exciting series. " ( Virat Kohli 's ruthlessness impressive : VVS Laxman ) Kohli , India 's leading batsman following the retirements of legends Sachin Tendulkar , Rahul Dravid , VVS Laxman and Virender Sehwag , said Dhoni was still short of full fitness. ( Not the summer to involve in sledging : Allan Border ) " We 'll be expecting him to be at 100 percent fitness over the next few days , " he said . " Obviously , we want him to be 100 percent fit before he plays a game and it 's too short a span for him to go into a Test match without having enough practice here. " Kohli said the players were no longer thinking about their heavily criticised performances in the heavy series loss to England . Just four months ago , the Indians , under Dhoni , capitulated 3-1 in England where the five-Test series finished with a colossal innings and 244-run loss at The Oval as the tourists collapsed to 94 all out in their second innings . " It 's just another two months in life , nothing bigger than that , " said Kohli , who scored just 134 runs in the series at a paltry 13.40 . - 'Emotional moment ' - " I do n't know why that England phase is still spoken about , most of us do n't want to remember it and even know what went on in those sessions and those Tests , " he added . " If you keep sulking about the past there 's no way you 're going to move on in life and that 's something I believe in. " Kohli would not divulge the Indian team for Tuesday 's Test , although he said batsman Bhuvneshwar Kumar was facing a fitness test on a left ankle sprain . Kohli said he was personally affected by the death of Australian batsman Phillip Hughes last month , which has had massive reverberations throughout the cricket world and forced the opening Test to be delayed and moved from Brisbane . " I think after attending the funeral I was as emotional and taken aback by the incident because Phil was one of the guys I used to interact with when he used to come on tours and even when I was in Australia , " he said . " I was in a camp with him in 2008 at Brisbane and I was always closer to him than most of the guys . " It was an equally saddening and emotional moment for me , but as professional cricketers you have to move on and do what needs to be done. " A number of tributes are planned for the Test with the Australian players wearing Hughes ' Test cap number 408 on their playing shirts , and black armbands in honour of their former team-mate . The team and spectators will be asked to stand for 63 seconds of applause before the start of play in recognition of Hughes 's unbeaten final score .
