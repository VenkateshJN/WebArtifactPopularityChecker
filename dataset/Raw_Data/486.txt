Last updated on Tuesday , 13 January , 2015 17 : 02 IST Total Shares Harris said Â© AFP Sydney : With the World Cup just a month away , Australia pacer Ryan Harris has expressed his disappointment and said he felt like a " bowling machine " on the batsman-friendly wickets . It was on these wickets that Australia captain Steven Smith and India captain Virat Kohli made tons of runs in the recently concluded Test series , which the home side won 2-0 . " The disappointing thing about the wickets we played on this summer , they were just so flat , " Harris was quoted as saying by Cricket Australia ( CA ) . Harris also added that as bowlers they just wanted pitches that have " a bit of bounce " so that there would be a good contest between bat and ball . " As a bowler , and we spoke about it during the last Test just how disappointing ( it is ) not to get a nice wicket , not so much a bowler-friendly green top , but a wicket with a bit of bounce at least where you could bowl a good bouncer , " said the 35-year-old . " The ball in that last Test lasted probably 10 or 11 overs before it was soft and ragged and it was almost reversing. It was a challenge but I like a bit more challenge between bat and ball.
