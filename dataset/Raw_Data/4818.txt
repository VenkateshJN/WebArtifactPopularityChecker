South Africa fought hard but could not just outdo a resilient Black Caps side who won the thrilling encounter with a ball and four wickets to spare . Chasing a revised target of 298 from 43 overs , determined by the Duckworth-Lewis system in the rain-affected match , New Zealand got over the line primarily due to the efforts of middle-order batsman Grant Elliot ( 84 not out ) , who bludgeoned pacer Dale Steyn into the stands for a six to seal the victory . Though it was an outstanding Proteas side who bowed out of the tournament , the South Africans also dropped a crucial catch offered by Elliot in the penultimate over as J.P. Duminy and substitute fielder Farhaan Behardien almost collided in the deep . Wicket keeper Quinton de Kock and speed merchant Steyn then missed a run-out opportunity in the last over . As the match got over , the chokers tag began trending at the fourth spot on Twitter .
