Meet the giant killers of World Cup cricket The author has posted comments on this article Soumitra Das , TNN | Mar 11 , 2015 , 03.56PM IST BANGLADESH Victims England ( 2015 ) : It was a must-win game for England , and not many thought Bangladesh would be able to defend 275 on a small ground. But Bangladesh defended their score like cornered tigers , and England wilted under pressure to lose the game by 15 runs and crash out of the tournament . India ( 2007 ) : 2007 WC is one series that India would really like to forget. A total of 191 was never going to be enough and Bangladesh easily chased it down. This defeat played a big role in India 's early exit . Pakistan ( 1999 ) : A five-wicket haul by Saqlain Mushtaq meant that Bangladesh could score only 223 in 50 overs. But they bowled and fielded superbly , and Pakistan got all out for just 161 . IRELAND Victims West Indies ( 2015 ) : Ireland can no longer be called minnows , as they continue to beat test playing countries in every edition. West Indies thought they had won the game after scoring over 300 runs , but Ireland chased down the target with over four overs to spare ! England ( 2011 ) : England set Ireland a massive target of 328 but Ireland pulled off a sensational win ! Pakistan ( 2007 ) : Pakistan crashed to an embarrassing defeat against Ireland and bowed out of the tournament . KENYA Victims Sri Lanka ( 2003 ) : Not many gave Kenya a chance after they scored just 210 in 50 overs , but Collins Obuya 's five-wicket haul saw Sri Lanka getting bundled out for just 157. Inspired by this famous win , Kenya went on to reach the semifinals of the tournament . West Indies ( 1996 ) : West Indies had superstars like Ambrose , Walsh , Lara , Chanderpaul and Richardson in their ranks , and it looked like they would easily overhaul Kenya 's paltry total of 166. What followed was a nightmare though , as the star-studded West Indian batting line-up completely collapsed at 93 . ZIMBABWE Victims India ( 1999 ) : India came agonizingly close to chasing Zimbabwe 's total of 252 , but a late order collapse saw them fall short by just three runs . South Africa ( 1999 ) : Zimbabwe had never beaten South Africa in one-day cricket before but on this day , even an inspired half-century from Lance Klusener could not save the South Africans . England ( 1992 ) : Zimbabwe struggled to reach 134 but England fared no better , and Graham Gooch 's first ball dismissal set the tone for a disaster. Eventually , they lost by nine runs . Australia ( 1983 ) : It was Zimbabwe 's first official one-day international and Duncan Fletcher , the current Indian coach , scored 69 as Zimbabwe posted a competitive 239. The Aussies fell short by 13 runs . INDIA Victims West Indies ( twice in 1983 ) : The West Indies , in those days , were an invincible side and other teams were scared to face them. Yet , India managed to beat them twice that year ! Even though India won the league game , many considered it to be just an off day for the great West Indies side and nobody gave Kapil 's Devils any chance when the two sides clashed again in the final. But India managed to defend just 183 to win their first World Cup title !
