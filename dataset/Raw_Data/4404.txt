The 17-Test veteran , who shared a record partnership in school cricket with Sachin Tendulkar , was named a member of the Cricket Improvement Committee ( CIC ) , which was re-launched by the Mumbai Cricket Association ( MCA ) on Thursday . Besides Kambli , CIC , which will most likely be chaired by former India skipper Ajit Wadekar , will include Madhav Apte , Abey Kuruvilla Lalchand Rajput , Milind Rege and Sanjay Patil. The managing committee , chaired by Sharad Pawar on Thursday , has decided to empower the CIC completely this time . It will be responsible for all cricketing decisions , which includes appointment of coaches and selectors , and its decisions will not have to be approved by the managing committee , as was the case previously . The decision was taken by the Managing committee meeting of the association , which was chaired by president Sharad Pawar. The Annual General Meeting of the MCA will be held on Friday . It has also been decided that the recommendations of the MCA indoor cricket academy committee , chaired by Rajput , too will be implemented without any further approval from the MC .
