" We are keeping a close watch on Irfan but he requires atleast another six weeks rest under the rehabilitation program give to him by the medical panel , " chief selector Haroon Rasheed said . The former Test batsman said that even when Irfan recovers from his injury , the selectors would work out a schedule for him since he was injury prone . " He is an attacking bowler and he will not be played in all matches. We would like to keep him fit for the important games , " Rasheed said . On the selection of off-spinner , Saeed Ajmal who after being suspended from bowling in international cricket since last September has made a comeback with a modified action , the chief selector said Bangladesh would be a very important series for the spinner . " Saeed has been our leading bowler for the last few years and the team missed his guile and experience in the World Cup .
