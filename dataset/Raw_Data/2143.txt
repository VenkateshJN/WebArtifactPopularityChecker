( PTI Photo ) RELATED Chennai : Few can evoke the kind of fear Dale Steyn does in the minds of batsmen . Excerpts from a conversation with TOI.. . Are you happy with Hyderabad 's performance ? Yes and no. We have won matches against some tough opponents , but have also gone on to lose games which we should have won. The loss against Royal Challengers Bangalore is an example . Despite being hit by AB de Villiers the other night in Bangalore , you were gracious enough to share a laugh with him.. . AB is a dear friend of mine , and we are teammates in the South African national team. I have known him for long and on that night after the game I went up to him and said , " Well done , mate. " It was a tremendous knock by him . Who is the one bowler who has caught your attention in this IPL season ? I am very impressed with Bhuvneshwar Kumar. The best part about Bhuvi is that he not only swings the ball both ways , but has immense control. I find him extremely grounded and willing to learn all the time. Bhuvi will be an asset for India whenever they travel abroad , since conditions do favour the bowlers a bit . The toughest player to bowl to ? AB de Villiers. He is an impact player who has more than one shot for any delivery , which makes it difficult . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Royal Challengers Bangalore,IPL 7,Dale Steyn,Bhuvneshwar Kumar,AB de Villiers Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
