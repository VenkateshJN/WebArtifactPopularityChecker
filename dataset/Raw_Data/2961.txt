Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 Ireland were unbeaten in the tournament coming into this Pool B clash but their bowlers , particularly the seamers , were simply outclassed by South Africa 's prolific batsmen . It could even have been worse had Irish off-spinner Andy McBrine not removed the two top-ranked batsmen in the world , Amla and AB de Villiers ( 24 ) , in three balls in the 42nd over . Amla had been dropped on 10 and should have been run out on 104 but otherwise batted calmly and confidently , at one stage threatening to match Chris Gayle 's double century on the same pitch last Tuesday . As measured as his captain de Villiers is explosive , Amla reached his 20th one-day century from as many balls in a partnership of 247 with Du Plessis -- a record second-wicket stand for South Africa . His 159 came off 128 balls and he hit 16 fours and four sixes by the time he holed out to Ed Joyce in the deep , 36 overs after the same fielder had dropped him at midwicket off Kevin O'Brien 's first delivery . Amla became the quickest batsman to score 20 one-day centuries , achieving the feat in 108 innings compared to India 's Virat Kohli , who was the previous fastest to the mark in 133 knocks . Du Plessis also made his 109 from as many balls for his fourth ODI century before Kevin O'Brien bowled him through the gate , while Rilee Rossouw confirmed his fine form with a second successive quickfire innings of 61 . Ireland 's best moment came in the third over when John Mooney dismissed opener Quinton de Kock caught behind for one in a wicket maiden .
