NOR vs GLOUCS - Live England vs Sri Lanka , 22nd Match , Pool A Moeen Ali and Ian Bell got England off the blocks quickly , racing to 42 in the first five overs . Once the bowlers settled in , Bell literally had to sweat for his runs . Bell played well and all his seven boundaries were elegance personified. However , just when he looked set to get a big innings , he was cleaned up by Suranga Lakmal one short of a half-century . Gary Ballance found it difficult in the middle and his scratchy innings was ended by Tillakaratne Dilshan , whom he lobbed a simple return catch to for 6 . Joe Root held the innings together and became the youngest England player , at 24 , to score a World Cup century. This was Root 's fourth ODI ton . Jos Buttler 's quickfire unbeaten 19-ball 39 , including six boundaries and a six , gave England a late impetus , allowing them to post 309 for 6 , their second successive 300 plus total in the World Cup . Tillakaratne Dilshan continued his form from the previous game against Bangladesh at the MCG , and together with Lahiru Thirimanne , registered a century plus stand for the opening wicket . Lahiru Thirimanne came together for an unbeaten 212-run stand for the second wicket. This was Sri Lanka 's highest second-wicket partnership against England in ODIs . Kumar Sangakkara scored his second successive century of the 2015 World Cup. He reached the three-figure mark off 70 balls - his quickest , and remained not out on 117 . Lahiru Thirimanne was dropped twice on 3 and 99. He made the most of those chances and went on to score a career-best 137 . The record partnership between Sangakkara and Thirimanne helped Sri Lanka to chase down England 's 309 with 16 balls to spare. This big win put Mathews ' team level with New Zealand on the Pool A points table , while England remain second from last . Photo Gallery
