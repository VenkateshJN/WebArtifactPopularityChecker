( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 Gambhir , Sehwag star again to power Delhi to 4th straight win ( PTI ) CHANDIGARH : Gautam Gambhir led from the front with a breezy unbeaten 75 as Delhi cruised to a nine-wicket win over Haryana to record their fourth straight victory in a North Zone leg match of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy on Friday . Set a target of 141 runs by Haryana , star pair of Gambhir and Virender Sehwag ( 49 ) once again sizzled with the bat for Delhi , putting on a 96-ball 121-run stand for the opening wicket to set the platform for the win . While Sehwag 's was an unusually sedate knock , Gambhir was at his attacking best . Gambhir 's runs came off 53 balls during which he struck seven boundaries and three sixes. Sehwag , on the other hand , played second fiddle and hit just three fours and one six during his 50-ball knock . Sehwag was the lone Delhi wicket to fall , bowled by right-arm pacer Harshal Patel in the 16th over . After Sehwag 's dismissal , Gambhir and Unmukt Chand ( 7 not out ) ensured the win for Delhi with 15 balls to spare without any further damage . Earlier , Haryana rode on half centuries from opener Avi Barot ( 51 off 42 ) and Guntashveer Singh ( 64 off 49 ) to post 140 for seven after opting to bat . Apart from Barot and Guntashveer , no other Haryana batsmen could manage double digit scores. The duo scored 103 runs for the second wicket to propel Haryana to the modest score . The lanky Ishant Sharma was the pick of the bowlers for Delhi with figures of four for nine from his quota of four overs . Meanwhile , in another North Zone leg match Himachal Pradesh defeated Jammu and Kashmir by 17 runs at the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium in Mohali to register their second win in the tournament . Sent in to bat , Himachal could only muster 127 for eight before coming out with am impressive bowling display to bundle out J&K for 110 in 19.3 overs . Rishi Dhawan top-scored for Himachal with 44 off 40 balls. For J&K , left-arm spinner Waseem Raza ( 3/21 ) scalped three wickets while skipper Parveez Rasool ( 2/10 ) picked up two . Chasing the paltry target , J&K batsmen crumbled in front of the pace trio of Akshay Chauhan ( 4/16 ) , Rishi Dhawan ( 2/24 ) and Vikramjeet Malik ( 2/28 ) to slump to their fourth consecutive defeat in the event . Abid Nabi ( 39 ) and Pranav Gupta ( 28 ) provided some sort of resistance for J&K but it was not enought to sail them home . Brief Scores : Delhi vs Haryana in Chandigarh : Haryana : 140 for seven in 20 overs ( Guntashveer Singh 64 , Avi Barot 51 ; Ishant Sharma 4/9 ) . Delhi : 142 for one in 17.3 overs ( Gautam Gambhir 75 not out , Virender Sehwag 49 ; Harshal Patel 1/32 ) .
