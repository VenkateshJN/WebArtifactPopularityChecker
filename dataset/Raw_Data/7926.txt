The total is also the highest ICC Cricket World Cup score between two full nations . 72 - South Africa scored 72 runs in the batting powerplay , the most in the tournament . 34 - South Africa took 34 runs off a Jason Holder over - the 48th of the innings - the second-most ever in a ICC Cricket World Cup , after Herschelle Gibbs struck six sixes against The Netherlands to score 36 runs off Daan van Bunge in the 2007 edition of the tournament . 64 - De Villiers slammed his 150 off 64 balls , making it the fastest 150 in ODI cricket. Shane Watson 's 83-ball effort against Bangladesh in Mirpur in 2011 was the previous record. 64 is also the number of runs Holder conceded in the last two overs . 2 - Holder became the second bowler to concede more than 100 runs in the ICC Cricket World Cup – after New Zealand 's Martin Snedden , who gave away 105 runs against England at The Oval in 1983.
