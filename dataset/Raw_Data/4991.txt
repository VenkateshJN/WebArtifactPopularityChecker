Cricket Australia 's ( CA ) spokesman later revealed that there was n't any damage done although the batsman looked dazed for a moment . The all-rounder later skipped the team 's public appearance at the MCG for Cricket Australia 's Family Day activities , instead preferring to stay at the team hotel . " It was his last ball he was facing in the nets and it struck him somewhere near the temple region , " Waugh said , during commentary on tonight 's KFC T20 Big Bash League match in Hobart. " He was pretty much OK to start off with then he felt a little bit off colour back in his hotel room . " So , I believe he 's going to have a few tests overnight and well see how he comes up in the morning , so hopefully , he should be OK to play in the Test match , " Waugh added . Waugh said the selectors would wait for the test results before deciding if any reinforcements would be needed to the 13-man squad. Well see how the test goes in the morning , " he said . " There might be no need to add anyone hopefully that 's the case , but depending on what the doctors say , we 'll go from there. It could be an out-and-out batsman or it could be an all-rounder , it just depends , " Waugh added . © Cricbuzz ( with inputs from agencies ) More stories from India tour of Australia , 2014-15
