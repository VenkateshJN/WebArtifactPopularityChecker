Things look gloomy as the clay-based soil in the Eden outfield has high water-retention capacity. ( TOI Photo ) RELATED KOLKATA : Showers in the morning and afternoon forced Tuesday 's IPL Qualifier 1 playoff match between Kings XI Punjab and Kolkata Knight Riders to be postponed to Wednesday . It did stop raining in the evening , but umpires Nigel Llong and S Ravi found the ground unfit for play while making an inspection around 5 pm. After consultations with the curator , the umpires called off the match at 5.15 pm . The entire ground had been kept under cover , but there was ankle-deep water at several places on the edge of the field. Neither team took the trouble of travelling from the hotel to Eden Gardens . Wednesday is the official reserve day , when the match is due to start at 4 pm. But there is forecast for more rain overnight and on Wednesday too . Even if it does n't rain any further , there is little possibility of play , thanks to the nature of the Eden soil and the poor underground drainage system . The pitch and the bowler 's run-ups are fine , but the problem area is the outfield. The clay-based soil in the Eden outfield has high water-retention capacity . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Kolkata Knight Riders,Kings XI Punjab,IPL,George Bailey,Gautam Gambhir Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
