India starts looking for Fletcher 's replacement The author has posted comments on this article Gaurav Gupta , TNN | Jan 7 , 2015 , 11.25AM IST India failed miserably in overseas Tests during Fletcher 's reign. ( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 MUMBAI : With Duncan Fletcher set to leave after the World Cup , as his contract is coming to an end , the Indian board ( BCCI ) has started looking for a new coach for Team India . " We are talking to a few people. We have also asked the senior players in the side to give their opinion , " a source in the Board told TOI on Tuesday . The source revealed that Fletcher had wanted to quit some months back citing his wife 's ill health. However , with the World Cup and important tours round the corner , he was asked to stay back. While the nationality of the coach is not an issue , the board 's primary concern is that he should be able to 'communicate well with the boys' . This means the on-going Sydney Test against Australia will be Fletcher 's last in charge of the team. India failed miserably in overseas Tests during Fletcher 's reign , with the team slipping to a miserable No. 6 in the ICC rankings. However , they fared much better in the ODIs , where they rose to become the No. 1 side in the world . Fletcher struck a good rapport with Dhoni during his tenure but was sidelined following former India all-rounder Ravi Shastri 's appointment as the team director. Shastri , on his part , has praised Fletcher 's role in the side , revealing that the 'boys ' treat the 66-year-old Zimbabwean as a 'father figure' . A media report had recently claimed that skipper MS Dhoni had asked BCCI to appoint former Australian batsman Michael Hussey as the India coach. This was denied by the BCCI .
