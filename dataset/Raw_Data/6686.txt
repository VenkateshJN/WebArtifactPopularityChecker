David Boon got exactly 100 against West Indies in 1992 , which was also at the MCG . 86 Australia 's previous-highest individual score against England in the World Cup , by Ricky Ponting in the 2007 edition.

This is the second highest number of hundreds by an Australia batsman against England , the highest being Ponting 's five , from 38 innings . 7 Number of bowlers who have taken five-fors in their first World Cup game including Mitchell Marsh. Marsh 's 5 for 33 is the fourth-best haul by a bowler playing his first World Cup match. In addition to Marsh , three other Australia bowlers - Gary Gilmour , Dennis Lillee and Damien Fleming - have achieved this. Winston Davis ' 7 for 51 against Australia in 1983 leads this list . 111 Runs England lost this match by - their second-worst defeat in terms of runs in the World Cup. Their 122-run loss to South Africa in 1999 is their worst . 165 Glenn Maxwell 's strike rate in his innings of 66 runs in this match - the second-highest strike rate by an Australia batsman batting at No. 6 or lower in the World Cup.

Boon took 52 innings and Hayden 53. Greg Chappell took as many innings as Bailey has taken , but played two matches fewer . 342 Runs England conceded in this match - the highest they have conceded in a World Cup game , four runs more than the 338 they conceded against India in the tied game in 2011.
