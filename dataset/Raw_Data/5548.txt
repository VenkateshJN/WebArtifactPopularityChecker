Bowlers , Rohit lead India to facile win Perth , Sat , Feb 28 2015 by Tanmoy Mookherjee Last updated on Saturday , 28 February , 2015 , 10 : 58 AM Man of the Match R Ashwin took 4 for 25 , Ravindra Jadeja chipped in with 2 for 23 and Umesh Yadav had 2 for 15 UAE were all out for 102 , their lost ODI total Rohit Sharma scored 57 * off 55 balls Man of the Match Ravichandran Ashwin took 4 for 25. © Getty Today has been the day of bowlers. It took 55.3 overs for the New Zealand-Australia game to be decided , and after United Arab Emirates were shot out for 102 by India in 31.3 overs , it took the defending champions 18.5 overs to overhaul their target with the sole loss of Shikhar Dhawan to an outstanding catch by Rohan Mustafa. In hindsight , India had better won the toss. But at least it did n't take anything away from the thriller witnessed in Auckland earlier . Man of the Match R Ashwin took 4 for 25 , Ravindra Jadeja chipped in with 2 for 23 and Umesh Yadav had 2 for 15 , and every other Indian bowler was among the wickets to deem it a no-contest even before the Indian chase began. UAE 's narrow defeats to Zimbabwe and Scotland were encouraging signs for them and a cause of slight worry for India , but the defending champions steamrolled their weak opponents. Save for Shaiman Anwar 's 49-ball 35 , only two other batsmen reached double figures . Positively for India , though , Rohit Sharma batted himself into some form with an unbeaten 57 that included nine fours and a six , and Virat Kohli was 33 * as they wrapped up the match after a pointless 40-minute 'supper break ' when 15 runs were needed for victory. The other was the return of Bhuvneshwar Kumar , picked in place of Mohammed Shami , getting through five decent overs with a wicket. It has been India 's best start to a World Cup competition as they completed their third consecutive victory to stay on top of Group B . Buoyed by their previous efforts , UAE captain Mohammad Tauqir decided to have a bat under the blazing sun at the WACA ground and was made to regret his decision as soon as Umesh Yadav dug it in short to get the glove from Andri Berenger. Bhuvneshwar dug it in short and had Amjad Ali caught behind. Whoever turned up at the bowling crease got a wicket - such was the procession at the WACA . Shaiman Anwar , UAE 's best batsman on show , came in at No 6 and could only watch as Ashwin , Jadeja and Mohit Sharma struck in succession to reduce them to 71 for 9. But Anwar took a cue from Brad Haddin and Kane Williamson earlier and began farming the strike. UAE had somewhat seen off the damage caused by the faster bowlers earlier , but against Ashwin and Jadeja they looked all at sea with the surface offering generous turn . Anwar found support from No 11 Manjula Guruge and added 31 for the last wicket , their biggest partnership of the innings , but it was n't enough for UAE , who were bowled out for the lowest total in their short ODI history . Brief scores : UAE 102 in 31.3 overs ( Shaiman Anwar 35 ; R Ashwin 4/25 , Umesh Yadav 2/15 ) lost to India 4/1 in 18.5 overs ( Rohit Sharma 57 * , Virat Kohli 33 * ; Mohammad Naveed 1/35 ) by 9 wickets . © Cricbuzz Tags
