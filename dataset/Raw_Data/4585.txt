The 31-year-old did not train on Thursday with coach Chandika Hathurusingha admitting the veteran has been under the weather . " He ( Masharfe ) has had a sore throat so we will take the decision ( over playing him ) tomorrow , " said Bangladesh 's Sri Lankan coach . Mashrafe is also nursing a calf injury which he sustained in the win over Scotland but still played against England , taking 2-48 as his team claimed a 15-run win which put them into the quarterfinals for the first time . Mashrafe is also under threat of suspension for slow over rates which would rule him out of the quarterfinals where they are likely to face defending champions India . Bangladesh were two overs short of their target against England in Adelaide and Mashrafe was fined 40 percent of his match fee , while his players were docked 20 percent . Under International Cricket Council rules a captain can be suspended for two minor over-rate offences or one serious offence during the event .
