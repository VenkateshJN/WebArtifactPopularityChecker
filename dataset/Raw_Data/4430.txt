( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 ADELAIDE : David Warner and Glenn Maxwell smashed strokeful centuries to help Australia post 371 against a hapless Indian bowling attack in the first warm-up match of the cricket World Cup on Sunday . Electing to bat at the Adelaide Oval in a match where the two teams are playing their full 15-member squads , the hosts rode on Warner 's 104 and Maxwell 's 57-ball 122 , before he was retired out , to put up a challenging score as they lost all their 10 wickets in 48.2 overs . Warner hit the aggressive button from the very start as the left-hander smashed 14 fours and two sixes in his 84-ball stay . Opening the Indian bowling , medium-pacer Stuart Binny ( 1-41 ) gave them the first breakthrough in Aaron Finch ( 20 ) but Warner was unstoppable at the other end . Injured Ishant Sharma 's replacement in the World Cup squad , Mohit Sharma ( 2-62 ) got Shane Watson ( 22 ) back in the pavilion and Steven Smith ( 1 ) was cleaned up by Umesh Yadav to stop the Australian surge . Warner though still carried on in the same vein only to picked up left-arm spinner Axar Patel ( 1-47 ) in the 27th over and Australia were already 185 for four . Maxwell then took over and stitched a 91-run sixth-wicket stand with Mitchell Marsh ( 21 ) . In between captain George Bailey also hit a useful 44 before being scalped by Mohammed Shami ( 3-83 ) , who bagged three wickets but was expensive in his 9.2 overs . But Maxwell it was who made all the eight Indian bowlers look ordinary , hitting 11 fours and eight sixes with a strike rate of 214.03 . Umesh proved to be India 's most economical bowler with figures of 2-52 in his nine overs . Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
