World Cup 2015 : South Africa 's Dale Steyn fit for India clash The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Feb 20 , 2015 , 09.51AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 MELBOURNE : South Africa 's premier fast bowler Dale Steyn is fit to lead their attack in a key World Cup match against India on Sunday after recovering from a bout of sinusitis . " He is fine , there is nothing to be concerned about , " coach Russell Domingo said Friday , adding the bowler had gone down with a cold and 'flu during a practice match in Christchurch ahead of the tournament . South Africa will welcome Steyn 's return to full fitness for the Pool B match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after he appeared out of sorts over the past two weeks . The 31-year-old bowled just seven overs in his team 's first warm-up match against Sri Lanka and was rested for the second practice game against co-hosts New Zealand . Steyn was clearly troubled by a sore throat and blocked nose during South Africa 's World Cup opener against Zimbabwe in Hamilton last Sunday , where he returned with unflattering figures of one for 64 from nine overs against the Proteas ' lowly-ranked opponents . The form of Steyn , one of the game 's most devastating fast bowlers with 152 wickets from 97 one-day internationals , is seen as central to South Africa 's chances of winning a maiden World Cup title . He is the spearhead of a formidable attack that includes Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander , with Kyle Abbott and Wayne Parnell also in the mix for the India game .
