World Cup 2015 : Media barred from Indian team 's hotel The author has posted comments on this article PTI | Mar 12 , 2015 , 05.03PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 AUCKLAND : The just-elected office bearers of the BCCI might have shown some interest in improving its relationship with the media , but the Indian cricket team management continued to keep its distance from the touring national media contingent with members of the fourth estate being banned from entering the hotel premises , here on Thursday . Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 While in places like Adelaide , Melbourne , Perth and Hamilton , media did have access to the hotel lobby , the authorities of the 'Heritage Hotel ' here are very strict about even letting media people be within 100 metres of the premises . It is not known whether the authorities are issuing a diktat by the Indian team management , which is known to keep the media at arm 's length , but there was an altercation between reporters of some electronic channels on Thursday when they were filming the proceedings of movements in the hotel from across the road . It was learnt that some of the security staff of the hotel came and told them to move from the area even though the public road or footpath is not under their jurisdiction . Even as some of the media people wanted to have refreshments at the hotel 's coffee shop , they were told that if they are not staying in the hotel in no uncertain terms they wo n't be allowed inside . Since the relation between players and media had hit nadir during the current World Cup , it is absolutely possible that players and the support staff have told the hotel members to bar the media as some of the channels have been doing a paparazzi on the cricketers following them from sea beach to salon .
