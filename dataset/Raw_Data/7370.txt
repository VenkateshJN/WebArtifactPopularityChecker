Pakistan news January 21 , 2015 PCB asks for Hafeez action to be reassessed ESPNcricinfo staff shares 28 Will Mohammad Hafeez be able to contribute with more than just bat at the World Cup ? © AFP The PCB has asked the ICC to set a date for offspin-bowling allrounder Mohammad Hafeez to have his action officially reassessed. The test has been set for February 6 in Brisbane * , with the PCB hoping to have Hafeez cleared to bowl in time for the World Cup that begins on February 14 . While Hafeez is part of Pakistan 's World Cup squad , he will not be allowed to bowl in the tournament unless cleared , having been suspended from bowling in international cricket in December. Pakistan are already without the services of Saeed Ajmal for the World Cup , who has also been banned . Hafeez 's action was tested at an ICC accredited centre in Loughborough , England. The analysis , an ICC statement said , found the flex in his action to exceed the 15-degree limit for all deliveries. Later , he was sent to Chennai to undergo remedial work and unofficial tests on his bowling action at Sri Ramachandra University. He had failed one of those unofficial tests , in January ; he bowled 11 deliveries in that test , and of those the flex in six deliveries was above the 15-degree limit . If he fails the official test , the ICC 's Bowling Review Group ( BRG ) will specify a period during which Hafeez will not be entitled to approach the ICC for reassessment . Hafeez was first reported while playing for Lahore Lions during the Champions League T20 in September , but that sanction did not apply to international cricket. He was reported again after the first Test against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi in November . Ajmal , who is not part of the World Cup squad , will undergo official ICC testing in Chennai on January 24 . * January 23 , 2015 11 : 15 GMT : The story has been updated with the date of Hafeez 's test © ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
