World Cup 2015 : Kevin O'Brien fined for dissent The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Feb 25 , 2015 , 08.14PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 BRISBANE : Kevin O'Brien has been fined 30 percent of his match fee for disputing an umpire 's decision during Ireland 's thrilling World Cup win over the United Arab Emirates in Brisbane on Wednesday . The all-rounder was found to have breached the section of the International Cricket Council 's code of conduct relating to " showing dissent at an umpire 's decision " when he bowled a wide in the 48th over of the UAE innings , the governing body announced after the match . And , according to a statement from the ICC , he then " continued to question the umpire 's decision until bowling the next ball " . O'Brien has admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by match referee Ranjan Madugalle , meaning there was no need for a formal hearing . The 48th over saw Shaiman Anwar clearly annoy O'Brien by moving around his crease in exaggerated fashion long before he had bowled , with the medium-pacer twice pulling out when about to deliver . Eventually , on-field umpires Michael Gough and Nigel Long intervened by speaking to both players , while the same over saw Anwar become the first UAE batsman to score a World Cup hundred with a three off O'Brien . The UAE finished on 278 for nine , with O'Brien conceding an expensive 61 runs in his seven overs . But he was almost 'in credit ' by the end of the match after his 24-ball 50 helped revive Ireland 's innings and added vital late impetus to a run-chase that saw them win by two wickets with four balls to spare . Victory gave Ireland two wins from as many Pool B matches after their four-wicket defeat of the West Indies , and maintained their bid for a place in the quarter-finals .
