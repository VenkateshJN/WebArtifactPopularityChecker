( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 NEW DELHI : Indian skipper MS Dhoni opted out of the first three One-dayers against Sri Lanka because he feared aggravating a finger injury , according to sources.The Lanka ODIs are followed by a long tour to Australia ahead of the 2015 World Cup . " Dhoni does n't have a serious injury . If you are a wicketkeeper , your fingers are bound to get stiff. If you do n't give them time to heal , there can be a problem collecting the ball , " a senior BCCI official said , adding : " Also , he was playing non-stop and there was a need to give him some rest before the Australia tour. The captain himself was keen on a break. " Dhoni , who wanted to opt out of two Tests during the aborted West Indies series , is unlikely to return for the last two ODIs against Lanka.However , he will do so if the need arises. " It is not going to be easy for Dhoni or the team during the four-month-long Australia tour. So , this is a welcome period of rest , " sources said . It is not yet decided whether the team will return to India after the Australia series. " Some believe if the team is in good shape , there is no point in coming back all the way from Australia. Others say if the team members feel homesick , they can be back in India for a few days. It 's too early to decide. " In a similar situation in 1991-92 , when the Indian team played Australia in Australia before the World Cup Down Under , only Kapil Dev was allowed to return for a short break .
