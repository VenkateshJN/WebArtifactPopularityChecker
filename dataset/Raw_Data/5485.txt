20-02-2015 NEW ZEALAND The match between Sri Lanka and Canada at Paarl in the 2003 World Cup is the shortest match in World Cup history. Canada were bowled out for 36 , the lowest total in World Cups and Sri Lanka raced to the target in 4.4 overs. New Zealand , Sri Lanka and West Indies feature twice in the list. However , when it comes to a contest between two Test playing nations , then the match between Bangladesh and West Indies in Mirpur during the 2011 World Cup is the shortest. Bangladesh were bowled out for 58 and West Indies chased it down in 12.2 overs with nine wickets remaining . New Zealand love to bowl teams out cheaply during the month of February. In February 2011 , in the league game against Kenya , they bundled them out for 69 while they bundled out England for 123 in Wellington. The notable thing in the table is that all the teams , barring the New Zealand-England clash , were chasing a target of under 100. This clash in Wellington is the first instance when a team has chased down a total in excess of 100. South Africa chased down 109 in 12 overs against Bangladesh in Bloemfontein during the 2003 World Cup but Bangladesh 's innings had consumed 35 overs , thus a total of 47 overs in the match is not counted . CONCLUSION New Zealand played a complete game against England in Wellington. All facets in their game , batting , bowling and fielding , clicked and they executed their plans brilliantly. A master-class in swing bowling from Southee and a blitz from McCullum have ensured that New Zealand have ticked the right boxes as the tournament progresses. They have made a statement by the nature of their victory . Â© Cricbuzz Tags
