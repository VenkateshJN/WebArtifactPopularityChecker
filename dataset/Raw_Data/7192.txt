Slow bowlers have struggled to make an impact in Australia over the last few years , and that 's even truer for overseas offspinners shares 8 R Ashwin , who took nine wickets at 62.77 on the last tour to Australia in 2011-12 , is n't the only overseas spinner who has struggled in Australia Â© BCCI Shane Warne made the art of spin bowling sexy in Australia after a long time , but in the last few years Australia has n't been a good venue for spin bowling. There has been the odd top performance by a spinner - like Nathan Lyon 's 5 for 50 in the Boxing Day Test last year , Anil Kumble 's 5 for 84 in 2007 , or Monty Panesar 's 5 for 92 on the first day of the Perth Test in 2006 - but it 's been rare enough to count as an exception , not the rule . Since the beginning of 2006 , 45 Tests have been played in Australia , in which fast bowlers have taken 1089 wickets at an average of 31.94. The average is the fourth-best among all host countries during this period ( with a cut-off of 15 Tests ) , after South Africa ( 29.18 ) , West Indies ( 31.76 ) and New Zealand ( 31.79 ) . As the averages indicate , there 's hardly any difference among the numbers in West Indies , New Zealand and Australia . In the same period , however , spinners have managed only 312 wickets in Australia - a rate of 6.93 wickets per Test , compared to 24.2 per Test for the fast bowlers. It 's the average , though , that 's even more glaring : spinners concede 46.16 runs per wicket , which is easily the worst among all countries. In all countries where at least 15 Tests have been played during this period , the average for spinners ranges between 32 and 38 : the best is West Indies ' 32.75 , and the worst - excluding Australia - is 37.43 in New Zealand. Australia is about 23 % worse than New Zealand , which says a bit about how much tougher it is for them in Australia compared to other countries. In fact , the difference in averages between No. 1 and No. 8 ( West Indies and New Zealand ) is less than the difference between No. 8 and No. 9 ( New Zealand and Australia ) . The strike rates are n't so different between Australia and New Zealand because spinners are a lot more economical in New Zealand , conceding 2.70 runs per over , compared to 3.31 in Australia , which is also the highest among all countries . Australia is also the only country where spinners have n't taken a single ten-for during this period. They 've even managed one in South Africa , with Saeed Ajmal taking 10 for 147 in Cape Town last year. Rangana Herath came close in Durban in 2011 , taking 9 for 128 , while Paul Harris and Graeme Swann also have nine-wicket hauls in South Africa. In Australia , though , the best by a spinner in a match is eight wickets , and even those wickets came at the cost of 200-plus runs : Panesar took 8 for 237 in Perth in 2006 , and Kumble 8 for 254 in Sydney in 2008. The last spinner to take a ten-for in Australia was Sri Lanka 's Upul Chandana , who took 10 for 210 in Cairns in 2004. In fact , the last nine ten-fors in Australia have all been by wristspinners ; Allan Border 's 11 for 96 against West Indies in 1989 was the last instance of a non-wristspinner taking ten in Australia. ( Click here for the full list of ten-fors by spinners in Australia. ) Australia is also the only country where spinners do n't have a single haul of more than five wickets in an innings .
