Umpires communication available on air in WC knockouts Tue , Mar 17 2015 Last updated on Tuesday , 17 March , 2015 , 01 : 37 PM The decision is likely to add more spice to what has already turned out to be a successful World Cup. © Getty The communication between on-field umpires and the third umpire in case of a TV referral will be available on air during the quarterfinals , semifinals and final of the 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand , an ICC press release said on Tuesday . The governing body trialled it during a five-ODI series between hosts Australia and South Africa late last year and received positive feedback on it . The viewer normally is not clued in on the conversation and is left to their own imagination but the ICC 's decision to make it available on air over the next seven matches will surely add more spice to what has already turned out to be a very successful World Cup . South Africa play Sri Lanka in the first quarterfinal at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Wednesday. This match will be followed by India-Bangladesh ( Thursday , Melbourne ) , Australia-Pakistan ( Friday , Adelaide ) and New Zealand-West Indies ( Saturday , Wellington ) ties . The semifinals will be played on March 24 and March 26 in Auckland and Sydney respectively and the winner-take-all contest will be played on March 29 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . © Cricbuzz
