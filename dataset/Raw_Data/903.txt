Here we look back at five other one-day international matches England would rather forget . March 2 , 1994 - Kingstown , St Vincent : Lost to West Indies by 165 runs ( Eoin Morgan : Crashing Out 'Unbelievably Disappointing ' ) England 's heaviest ODI defeat in terms of runs saw the West Indies pile up 313 for six , opener Desmond Haynes leading the way with 83. In reply England -- against one of the less celebrated West Indies ' attacks -- slumped to 148-9 in 50 overs , with Graeme Hick 's 32 the only individual score of 20 or more in the innings . July 1 , 2006 - Headingley : Lost to Sri Lanka by 8 wickets ( England 's One-Day Woes ) A terrible day for English cricket started with the death of fast bowling great Fred Trueman. The confusion among fans at the Yorkshire legend 's Headingley home ground on how to pay tribute -- some stood for a minute 's silence while others applauded -- was echoed by England 's bowlers . Defending a seemingly stiff target of 322 , they were rendered helpless as Upul Tharanga ( 109 ) and Sanath Jayasuriya , with a stunning 152 , put on 286 for the first wicket -- still a world record opening partnership in ODIs -- with fast bowler Stephen Harmison 's 10 wicketless overs costing 97 runs . March 2 , 2011 - Bangalore : Lost to Ireland by 3 wickets An experienced England side were stunned at the World Cup by their non-Test opponents as Ireland recorded one of the greatest wins in their cricket history. Batting first , England made 327 for eight featuring 92 from Jonathan Trott and 81 by Ian Bell. With Ireland 111 for five in the 25th over , the match was going according to the formbook . But Kevin O'Brien had different ideas , smashing the fastest-ever World Cup hundred , off just 50 balls , before John Mooney ( 33 not out ) saw Ireland home with five balls to spare . March 26 , 2011 - Colombo : Lost to Sri Lanka by 10 wickets 'Anything can happen in a knockout game ' was the positive spin of loyal England followers before this World Cup quarter-final against Sri Lanka . Instead it became the most lopsided last eight clash imaginable. Firstly England were held to 229 for six before Tharanga ( 102 not out ) and Tillakaratne Dilshan ( 108 not out ) saw Sri Lanka to victory with 63 balls to spare in front of their own fans . February 20 , 2015 - Wellington : Lost to New Zealand by 8 wickets After starting their World Cup campaign with a 111-run defeat by Australia , it was hard to imagine that England 's next game might produce an even more comprehensive defeat -- but that 's what happened . England , after winning the toss , were skittled out for just 123 in 33.2 overs , with swing bowler Tim Southee taking a national record seven for 33 . New Zealand , on the back of captain Brendon McCullum 's whirlwind 77 at the top of the order , raced to their victory target in 12.2 overs . A match meant to last 100 overs was completed in 45.4 .
