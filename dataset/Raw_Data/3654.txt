Hall of Fame entrant Kumble relishes honour The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Feb 21 , 2015 , 11.57AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 MELBOURNE : Former India captain Anil Kumble enters cricket 's Hall of Fame on Sunday , saying he was honoured to become only the fourth player from his country to join the elite club . " Its a great honour to be inducted into the Hall of Fame , " the 44-year-old Kumble told reporters at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday. " I am proud to be part of great luminaries. " The former leg-spinner will be presented a commemorative cap in a special ceremony in front of some 80,000 spectators during the innings break of the World Cup match between South Africa and India on Sunday . Kumble 's 619 wickets is the third highest in Test cricket behind fellow spinners Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka , who has 800 wickets , and Australian Shane Warne ( 708 ) . Kumble , who retired in 2008 after a 18-year career in which he played 132 Tests and 271 one-dayers , captained India in 14 Tests between 2007 and 2008 , winning three and losing five . He is only the second bowler after Englishman Jim Laker to claim all 10 wickets in a Test innings , achieving the feat against traditional rivals Pakistan at the Ferozeshah Kotla in New Delhi in 1999 . Despite his record , Kumble admitted he lacked the skills of both Muralitharan and Warne . " I could never compete with them because I did not have their skills , " said Kumble. " But it is their friendship I will treasure all my life. " Kumble is the 77th inductee in the International Cricket Council 's Hall of Fame which includes three other Indians -- Sunil Gavaskar , Kapil Dev and Bishan Bedi .
