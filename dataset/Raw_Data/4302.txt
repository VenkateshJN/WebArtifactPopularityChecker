Steyn recovering from flu ahead of India tie The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Feb 18 , 2015 , 01.03PM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 MELBOURNE : South Africa 's premier fast bowler Dale Steyn missed training on Wednesday due to flu , but is expected to be fit for the World Cup match against India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 " He has a bout of sinusitis but will be back at training tomorrow , " the team 's media manager Lerato Malekutu told AFP . Even though Steyn looks certain to take the field in Sunday 's key Pool B match against the defending champions , his presence has been underwhelming in the first week of the tournament . The paceman bowled just seven overs in South Africa 's first warm-up match against Sri Lanka and was rested for the second game against hosts New Zealand . Steyn was said to be suffering from a sore throat and blocked nose during their World Cup opener against Zimbabwe , where he returned with unflattering figures of one for 64 from nine overs against the lowly-ranked opponents . Steyn , one of the game 's most devastating fast bowlers who has 152 wickets from 97 one-dayers , will be needed in prime form if South Africa are to win their maiden World Cup title . Meanwhile , the squad 's two consultants , former South African opening batsman Gary Kirsten and Australian Michael Hussey , joined the players at training at the St. Kilda club ground . Kirsten , who was India 's coach when Mahendra Singh Dhoni 's men won the 2011 World Cup , is a part-time adviser with his home team. Hussey was specifically taken on board for the current tournament .
