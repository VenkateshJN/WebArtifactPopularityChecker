( AFP Photo ) Page 1 of 4 MANCHESTER : There was good news for the victorious England team on Sunday when it was revealed that their injured pacer Stuart Broad could be fit to play in the Oval Test beginning next Friday . Broad , who confirmed on Saturday that he will undergo facial surgery to fix the shape of his nose that was smashed by a Varun Aaron bouncer , has been included in England 's 13-member squad for the final Test after he indicated that he could play with a protective face mask - the sort worn by footballers . England selectors have named an unchanged squad for the fifth Test after Broad tweeted a picture of his injured nose , suggesting that the injury was not grave enough . The impact on Broad 's nose could have been much greater had the ball not hit the helmet and squeezed in between the grille and peak and got lodged there . It forced a profusely bleeding Broad to retire hurt. Broad will also undergo a knee surgery after the current series and hopes to be fit in time for the 2015 World Cup . England squad : Alastair Cook , Sam Robson , Gary Ballance , Ian Bell , Joe Root , Moeen Ali , Jos Buttler , Chris Woakes , Chris Jordan , Ben Stokes , Stuart Broad , James Anderson , Steve Finn .
