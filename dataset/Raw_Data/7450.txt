2 1 16.5 to Samuels , 81.2 kph , he 's lofted into the deep again ! Came down the pitch , think he was aiming leg side but there was a hint of turn and it took the thick outer part of the bat and flew to long off. Was a very well judged catch as the rope was fairly close. But another ( yet another ) reckless shot from Samuels 52/5 25.2 to Carter , 94.6 kph , given lbw. He went to pull a short ball which skidded on and struck the back leg. Carter reviewed and my gut was that this did n't look out at first glance. Turned a fair bit. Missing leg ? Oh , it 's clipping leg ! The decision will stand. 87/7 28.5 to Brathwaite , 83.5 kph , bigger appeal ! This looked better , another googly which catches him on the crease and this time de Villiers agrees to the review. Has it turned too much ? No , it has n't ! It crashes full into the top of leg stump. Good call from captain and bowler 95/8 33.4 to Benn , 76.7 kph , and that is that...changes down the pitch , head in the air , misses his swing to the leg side and provides an easy stumping chance. A fitting way to end the innings , frankly. 122/10 South Africa innings ( target : 123 runs from 50 overs ) R
