Although his finger has been strapped for the past one week , Pietersen has batted in the nets and also faced throwdowns during the three-day session at the Airforce ground in Palam before boarding the Dubai-bound flight . Team 's CEO Hemant Dua said that there is no such information with him that Pietersen wo n't be available for the first match , contrary to reports in some quarters . " I have not received any information as yet that KP wo n't be playing the first match. I will get to know better once I reach there tomorrow. We have a practice match tomorrow , " Dua said . While there is a chance that Pietersen might not field , there is a chance he might just bat to see how his little finger is holding up. In case the doctor tells him to rest , he might just directly play the first match on Thursday . On Saturday , during team 's jersey launch at a city hotel , Pietersen was asked about the protective padding and he seemed dismissive about the state of the injury . " I sustained it in England but just trying to protect it and not shaking hands with anyone. But it 's not a big problem , " he answered a query at the launch yesterday . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Kevin Pietersen,IPL,Indian Premier League,Hemant Dua,Delhi Daredevils Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
