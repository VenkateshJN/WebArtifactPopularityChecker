On March 21 , Martin Guptill , much to the delight of the crowd gathered at the Wellington Regional Stadium , produced a magnificent knock that broke a series of records , and he became the sixth One-Day International double centurion in the process . Guptill powered New Zealand to 393 for 6 before it sealed a 143-run win in its ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 quarter-final clash against West Indies to reach the semi-finals of the tournament for the seventh time – joining Australia for the most appearances in the last four . Below , we have some of the statistical highlights from the match . 237 : Guptill 's 237 took him past Chris Gayle to set the new record for the highest individual score in an ICC Cricket World Cup match. Gayle had made 215 in West Indies ' Pool B clash against Zimbabwe earlier in the tournament . Guptill went past the New Zealand ICC Cricket World Cup record of 171 not out , made by Glenn Turner against East Africa in Edgbaston back in 1975 , as well as the highest individual score by a New Zealand batsman in ODIs that he had himself set when he made 189 not out against England in Southampton in 2013 . Guptill 's 237 now sits only behind Rohit Sharma ’ s 264 , scored against Sri Lanka in 2014 , in the list of highest individual scores in ODIs . 35 : Guptill crossed the boundary 35 times in his innings – 24 fours and 11 sixes – an ICC Cricket World Cup record. The record was previously held by Gayle , who had struck 26 boundaries ( 10 fours and 16 sixes ) on the way to his 215 . 2 : West Indies became the first team to have two double centuries scored against it in ODIs. Before Guptill 's 237 not out , Virender Sehwag had made 219 against it in December 2011 at the Holkar Stadium in Indore . 0 : With the latest reversal , West Indies ’ record of never managing to chase down a target of 300 or more in an ODI remained unchanged. Its highest successful chase came against South Africa in 2004 , when it made 300 for 3 in pursuit of a 298-run target . 393 : New Zealand 's 393 for 6 is the highest score by any team in an ICC Cricket World Cup knockout match. Australia , who had made 359 for 2 in the final of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2003 against India , held the record . 31 : A total of 31 sixes were hit in the match – 15 by New Zealand and 16 by West Indies – the most in a single ICC Cricket World Cup match.

AB de Villiers , who has hit 20 sixes in the ongoing tournament , is next in the list and has a maximum of two matches to try and get past Gayle . 7 : By the time he reached his half-century , Gayle had already struck seven sixes – the first time so many sixes have been hit in the first 50 runs by a batsman in ODI history .
