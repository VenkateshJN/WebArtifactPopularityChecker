Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 " They played very good cricket , over 300 is always a difficult score , I felt it was just over par , they could have had 350. We came back quite well but I felt we still could have bowled better. The spinners performance was good but I feel the fast bowlers could have done slightly better , " Dhoni said in the post-match presentation . Dhoni 's run-a-ball 65 stood tall amid a disappointing batting show as he waged a lone battle to take India past the 200-run mark and make a match of it despite the steep asking rate . Shikhar Dhawan ( 45 ) and Rohit Sharma ( 34 ) started off well with a 76-run opening stand and Ajinkya Rahane contributed with a patient 44 in the middle overs. The Australian bowlers kept getting wickets to keep the Indian asking-rate mounting and Dhoni rued Shikhar 's dismissal . " We started okay but they bowled well , they got the reverse swing going. We were happy with where we were at the start of the tournament. We got off to a very good start , Shikhar 's dismissal was slightly on the softer side , at a time when we could have had the bowling under pressure. Did n't really need to play a big shot. But you get pressure chasing 300 + , makes you do things you do n't want to do , " he said . " There was too much ( for me to do ) , our lower order ca n't contribute too much in these conditions. Most of the good teams bat quite deep , " he added . On been asked to comment on his future career path , Dhoni the wicketkeeper-batsman said , " Not sure ( about next World Cup ) , I 'm 33 , I 'm still running , still fit. Next year , T20 World Cup , will be time to decide about 2019 or not.
