" I do n't know what pressure means , " he said in an interview. " I 'm always used to pressure situations , so I would n't even know what pressure is to talk about it. I want to have a free mindset and do what I can do . " Throughout my career I have n't been looking out where I 'm playing or what are the conditions. We know it will be bouncy here , but I always trust my skill , " he said . Malinga 's preparation for the mega event was hampered by a long-term ankle complaint. He required surgery and has been gradually working his way up to match-fitness. While he admitted to still feeling pain but is expected to play Sri Lanka 's warm-up matches against South Africa ( Feb 9 ) and Zimbabwe ( Feb 11 ) . Sri Lanka face the curtain-raising match of the tournament against co-hosts New Zealand Feb 14. " In the last few days , I 've been bowling with my full run-up , and I feel like I have good rhythm , " he said. " I do n't know about the pace , so we 'll find that out in the matches. Before the World Cup , I have to use these two warm-up matches to the maximum. " The 31-year-old said he was not only preparing himself physically but was developing his mental aspect as well to cope with the task of leading his team 's bowling charge at the competition. " I have n't had much skills preparation in the last few months , but I always do my mental preparation. I watched all my footage in the last two months and figured out what I needed to do , " the right-arm pacer said .
