2 1 4.6 to Maxwell , Southee completes a fine catch , no Maxwell magic today for Kings XI Punjab. Maxwell backs away and aims to smash this back of a length ball away over the off side , but does not get hold of it as he can only splice it. Southee moves to his left from mid-off , dives and snaffles the take 46/3 18.3 to Johnson , Johnson perishes for nought after being hoodwinked by Faulkner 's change of pace. Oh wait , the umpires are checking for a possible no-ball. He may have had some part of his heel behind the bowling crease. Johnson aims to go big and holes out to long-off 129/7 18.6 to Bailey , Oh what an insane catch ! Superb tag-team work from Southee and Karun Nair. What presence of mind. The fielding has veered from ordinary to extraordinary tonight. This is an extraordinary , assisted hokey-pokey catch. On a length and on the leg stump , Bailey attacks it and sends it into the Pune night sky. Tim Southee goes as far back on the long-on boundary as he could , leaps , plucks out his right hand and takes it. But his balance is shot as the momentum threatens to take him over the ad boards. However , he has the presence of mind to pass it to Karun , who dives across to his right and hangs onto a low catch. This is one for archived viewing 131/8
