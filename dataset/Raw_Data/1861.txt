IPL far away , focus is on World Cup , says Boult The author has posted comments on this article Dwaipayan Datta , TNN | Feb 18 , 2015 , 10.08AM IST Share on Linkedin Page 1 of 4 DUNEDIN : There 's a refreshing frankness about the way New Zealand players conduct themselves. Trent Boult , who swung it around beautifully to set up the win over Scotland on Tuesday , later spoke about how a group of New Zealand players were all glued to the internet on World Cup match-eve , tracking the IPL auction . " Quite a few of us were together , following the developments at the auction. It was a unique , once-in-a-lifetime experience. I think it has n't settled down yet , " Boult said , when asked to explain the emotions after being picked by Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs 3.8 crore . Unlike an Indian set-up , nobody was monitoring the questions at the press conference , asking to keep it World Cup-specific. And Boult , too , was happy to answer all IPL-related queries which flew in thick and fast . " I had put in my name for the auction a couple of months back and it seemed that it was never going to happen. It has finally happened now and is really exciting. " While Boult and Adam Milne went for a big price , Kane Williamson , seen as the best batsman in the New Zealand line-up , was bought by SRH for a comparatively lower price. Ross Taylor , a big-hitting veteran , meanwhile , went unsold. Boult said that everyone took the developments sportingly . " All of them were happy for Adam and me , we all celebrated together , " the pacer said . Boult also assured that they are not thinking about the IPL auction drama. " It was a two-minute thing , and there 's no question of losing focus. The IPL is still far away , our focus is on the Cup.
