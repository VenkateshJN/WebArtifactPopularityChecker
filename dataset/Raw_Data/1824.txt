Closer home , HL College of Commerce put up a very a dominating display to thrash Khambhat 's Arts , Commerce and Science College by an innings and 280 runs in the final of Gujarat University Inter-Zonal Cricket Tournament . Naman Patel was the hero of the day as his unprecedented 10-wicket haul saw his team HLCC bowled out their rivals for a embarrassing 28 in their first innings. He bowled perfect line and length all through his spell and hardly gave any leverage to the opponents ' batsmen . Dashing batsman Poojan Patel then slammed an unbeaten 100 while Tarang Chhatrola ( 32-ball 68 ) and Raxlee Taylor ( 27-ball 50 ) slammed quickfire half-centuries as HLCC declared their first innings at a mammoth 359 for six. HLCC bowlers continue to dominate the show in the second innings of Khambhat college as Meet Shah then took six wickets while Karan Patel chipped in with two more as they bowled out their hapless rivals for 51 to win the match .
