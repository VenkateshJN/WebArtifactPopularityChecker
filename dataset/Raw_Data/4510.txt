So devastating was the impact of this result , that India were sent packing from the tournament in the preliminary stages itself , leading to widespread anger among fans . The eastern neighbours meet again - this time in the quarters of the marquee competition in Melbourne on Thursday - and Bashar is following proceedings keenly in Dhaka. " I am impressed with the fight our team has put up , " the 42-year-old , who is also part of the Bangladesh national selection panel , told TOI . Is he surprised that they have reached the last eight at the cost of England , a team that reached the final when the event was last held Down Under in 1992 ? " I am not surprised.The boys have potential and they have fought really hard " Interestingly , Tamim Iqbal , Mushfiqur Rahim , Shakib Al Hasan and skipper Mashrafe Mortaza were part of the side that beat India on that fateful day eight years ago , while skipper MS Dhoni is the only member who was part of the Indian team . " It is important that the boys do n't let the pressure get to them.After all , India are still the overwhelming favourites in the game. I am sure Mashrafe and Shakib will tell the boys that if we could beat India eight years ago , we can beat them this time too.They should not fear India.
