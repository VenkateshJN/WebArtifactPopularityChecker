Full Coverage : ICC World Cup 2015 Shane Bond 's 6-19 against India in 2005 was the previous best . Southee was ably supported by Trent Boult , who put pressure on the England top order with an eight-over opening spell in which he took one wicket for 30 runs . Left arm spinner Daniel Vettori then dried up the runs in the middle overs and captured the wicket of out-of-form England captain Eoin Morgan for 17 . Southee did not get much movement in sunny conditions at the top of the innings after Morgan had won the toss and decided to bat but still managed to bowl Ali ( 20 ) and Bell ( eight ) with yorkers that did swing late . Boult then had Gary Ballance caught by Kane Williamson at short cover for 10 to leave England at 57 for three in the 14th over . Joe Root and Morgan , who had scored a total of two runs in his last five knocks , managed to slowly consolidate England 's innings , though their run rate was pedestrian as the skipper struggled with his timing and confidence . Vettori heaped more pressure on the beleaguered Morgan when he was deceived in flight and ended up dragging the ball aerially towards the leg side . Milne sprinted about 30 metres and flung himself at the ball to take a brilliant catch that brought the crowd to their feet . England 's lower order then collapsed , slumping from 104 for five to 123 all out with Southee producing a spell of five for 10 in four overs . Root was last out for 46 when he was caught in the deep .
