Friday ’ s opening clash at the SCG will see Australia host England with Michael Clarke ’ s men keen to edge a point clear of MS Dhoni ’ s side at the top of the ODI team rankings. It will be a dress rehearsal for the eagerly anticipated ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 opening match , which will see the same sides play each other in exactly 30 days ’ time in Melbourne . Following its 5-0 home series victory over Sri Lanka in November , reigning champion India will be bidding to gain further momentum and become only the third side in ICC Cricket World Cup history to successfully defend its title ( after West Indies in 1975 and 1979 and Australia , who won the coveted prize three times in succession between 1999 and 2007 ) . Meanwhile , South Africa , bidding to lift the 50-over title for the first time after reaching the semi-finals when Australia and New Zealand last hosted the ICC Cricket World Cup back in 1992 , welcomes West Indies to Durban on Friday in the first of a five-match ODI series , with two of the world ’ s top three batsmen in the Reliance ICC Player Rankings for ODI Batsmen set to feature . Proteas captain AB de Villiers is in pole position in the batting rankings on 887 points and the 30-year-old Pretorian holds a 25-point advantage over second placed India batsman Virat Kohli , with Hashim Amla one place further back in third spot . There are several permutations that could emerge over the coming weeks as New Zealand and Sri Lanka are also battling it out in their seven-match series , with the Black Caps currently holding a 1-0 lead after its three-wicket victory in the first ODI on Sunday . After this series , New Zealand will complete its ICC Cricket World Cup preparations when it plays host to Pakistan – who lifted the CWC trophy back in 1992 - in two ODI ’ s ahead of its opening game of the tournament in Christchurch against Sri Lanka , also on 14 February .
