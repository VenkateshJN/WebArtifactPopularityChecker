Early numbers indicate this could be the best World Cup of all for batsmen , especially in the last ten overs shares 5 David Miller scored 74 runs off 29 balls in the last ten overs in South Africa 's World Cup opener against Zimbabwe Â© AFP This was supposed to be a World Cup that bowlers would enjoy , with pitches offering more pace and bounce , and with two new balls to further exploit these conditions. These are admittedly early days in the tournament , with only eight games done out of 49 , but the indications are that batsmen are n't having too much trouble coping with the conditions . There have already been six totals in excess of 300 , which is more than the number of such totals in the entire 1996 World Cup. Only three World Cups have had more than six 300-plus totals , with the record being 17 , in 2011. With 41 matches to go here , it 's highly unlikely that record wo n't be surpassed , and by a substantial margin. So far in this tournament , the average run rate is 5.71 , well in excess of 2011 's 5.03 . The stats in the batting Powerplay are n't very different from the 2011 edition : in 2011 , the average run rate in the first ten overs was 4.73 , and the average runs per wicket 34.19. This time , the average run rate has been 4.69 , and the runs per wicket 35.76 . The bowlers have kept things in check at the start of the innings , but thereafter , the batsmen have taken over. In the middle overs ( 11th to 40th ) , the average run rate has been 5.42 , up from 4.71 in 2011 , while the biggest difference has been in the last ten : the average in this World Cup so far has been 8.40 , up from 7.01 in 2011 , an increase of 20 % . Already in this tournament , four times teams have scored 100 or more runs in the last ten : South Africa made 146 against Zimbabwe in Hamilton , while West Indies blasted 124 against Ireland in Nelson. Also , on the very first day of the tournament , both home teams made 100-plus in the last ten : Australia got 105 versus England , and New Zealand managed 102 against Sri Lanka . The numbers look particularly good - from the batting point of view - for the matches played in New Zealand so far. In eight innings , the average run rate in the last ten overs there is 8.89 , compared with 7.60 in the six innings in Australia. The average balls per four is almost the same in both countries so far - 6.72 in New Zealand , and 6.75 in Australia , but the smaller grounds in New Zealand are helping swell the sixes tally there : there has been an average of one struck every 19.5 balls , compared to one every 35.7 balls in Australia. Because there have been more balls bowled in the last ten overs in matches played in New Zealand so far , the overall average is closer to the average currently in New Zealand. At the moment , the frequency of sixes in this World Cup is significantly better than the previous one , though that should change as more matches are played in Australia .
