Amla named new South African Test captain The author has posted comments on this article AFP | Jun 3 , 2014 , 04.50PM IST Hashim Amla , 31 , who made his Test debut against India in Kolkata 10 years ago , said he was " glad and humbled " by the appointment. ( TOI Photo ) Page 1 of 4 JOHANNESBURG : South African star batsman Hashim Alma was named the country 's Test cricket captain on Tuesday , replacing retiring Graeme Smith who led the side for a decade . A " glad and humbled " Amla said he would give " all his heart " to the role . Amla , 31 , who made his Test debut against India in Kolkata 10 years ago , praised the work done by his predecessor , whose legacy looms large . Smith had captained South Africa in a world-record 109 Tests before announcing his retirement during the third and final Test against Australia last March . Selectors said his replacement had been seen as a choice between three world class batsmen , Amla , AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis . But it was Amla , a devout muslim who has often shied away from the public eye , who won out . Amla captained the South African team at the Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand in 2002 and was appointed captain of the Dolphins franchise early in his first-class career . He resigned as captain after one season to concentrate on his batting. Amla was appointed De Villiers ' vice-captain of the South African ODI team in 2011 and led the side in three matches , but gave up the job last year . Amla was reappointed to that position on Tuesday. Amla 's first assignment will be to lead South Africa in two Tests in Sri Lanka during July .
