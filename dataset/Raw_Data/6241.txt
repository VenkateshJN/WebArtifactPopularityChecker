High Court backs inmates ' World Cup plea ESPNcricinfo staff Tweet | Inmates in an Indian prison have successfully argued in the High Court that watching the World Cup is part of their fundamental human rights . The High Court in Guhawati has ordered that a cable connection must be laid within five days with Justice Arup Kumar Goswami ruling : " Prisoners need recreation for a healthy mind. " Although prisoners were already able to watch the state-run Doordarshan channel , which is screening India 's matches , the majority of matches in the World Cup are only available on cable TV . Lawyers representing the prisoners had argued that television was part of the " right to life and personal liberty " set out by India 's constitution . The ruling only applies to " under trial prisoners " - those whose case has not yet been heard . It remains to be seen if the whole of India will now petition that the chance to watch the World Cup is a right they can not fairly be denied . Â© ESPN Sports Media Ltd .
