The members Shah Rukh had a tiff with a couple of years back are still around at the Wankhede Stadium. ( TOI Photo ) RELATED MUMBAI : The MCA 's stand-off with the BCCI on hosting the IPL final at the Wankhede Stadium on June 1 may actually end with an unexpected piece of good news for Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan . The Kolkata Knight Riders ' owner , who was banned from the Wankhede Stadium by the MCA for five years after an altercation with the association 's officials in 2012 post an IPL game involving his team , may be allowed to enter the stadium and watch the final from the stands , even though his ban is officially supposed to end in 2017 . One of the conditions that the IPL Governing Council ( GC ) has put forward to the Mumbai Cricket Association ( MCA ) to change its stance of awarding the final to Bangalore , is that " all the team owners , including Shah Rukh Khan must be allowed entry into the Wankhede for the final. " It remains to be seen if the MCA agrees to this condition , since the members Shah Rukh had a tiff with a couple of years back are still around . An official , however , did n't rule out cutting short SRK 's ban to 'bring back ' the final to Mumbai from Bangalore . " We may call a Managing Committee ( MC ) meeting to end the ban. We will also take MCA president Sharad Pawar 's view on this matter , " he said . On Tuesday , the IPL GC , after a meeting at the BCCI office here , decided to defer the decision over the protest letter it received from Pawar on Sunday , after it was announced a day earlier that the IPL final would be shifted to Bangalore from Mumbai . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Wankhede,Shah Rukh Khan,MCA,IPL,BCCI Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
