Gibson , 46 , previously worked with England 's pace attack from 2007-10 before being appointed as West Indies coach . ECB managing director Paul Downton said the appointment was a short-term one as they seek a replacement for David Saker who will join Big Bash franchise Melbourne Renegades in September . " We are delighted to have secured a bowling coach of Ottis ' calibre as he is highly respected among the fast bowling fraternity and his knowledge and experience of local conditions will be invaluable in the Caribbean , " Downton said in a statement . " No decision has yet been made on a long-term replacement for David and we will need to review how we staff this position going forward following the conclusion of the West Indies tour.
