Why Mumbai Indians got that extra ball TNN | May 27 , 2014 , 09.28 AM IST Mumbai Indians ' Aditya Tare celebrates the victory in their IPL 7 match against Rajasthan Royals in Mumbai. ( PTI Photo ) RELATED The final score rather than the target score is taken into account for calculation of net run rate. Mumbai Indians needed to win in 87 deliveries , but that would have been the case had they scored exactly 190 , the target score . Mumbai Indians could have taken a few more balls to get their NRR to the required level and achieved a final score superior to the target score had they signed off with a boundary . When they failed to scamper for two runs to get to 190 in 14.3 overs , and the scores were level , their net run rate of 0.078 was higher than Rajasthan Royals ' NRR of 0.076 . Scoring just one run off the next ball would have seen their NRR slip below that of RR. Thus hitting a four or six for a win was the only option . What is interesting though is that MI could have got through even by playing out a dot ball , but then would have had to hit a four or a six off 14.5 or 14.6 overs for their NRR to be superior to that of the Royals . In fact , they could even have played three dot balls and could have gone through had they struck a six off the first ball of the 15th over. In that case , MI 's run rate would have been 0.080519 against RR 's 0.074163 . http : //timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms ? alias = Rajasthan Royals,Mumbai Indians,IPL,Corey Anderson,Aditya Tare Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device .
