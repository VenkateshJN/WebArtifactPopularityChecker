Majid Haq sent back home for breaking code of conduct Wed , Mar 11 2015 Last updated on Wednesday , 11 March , 2015 , 02 : 24 PM © AFP Majid Haq , the Scotland offspinner , has been sent back home from the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 by the Scotland Cricket team for breaking the code of conduct. Haq , 32 , is Scotland 's all-time top wicket-taker , but he was not selected for the game against Sri Lanka at Hobart. Scotland was thrashed by 148 runs . Haq took to micro-blogging site twitter to express his frustration at not being selected in the playing XI , and tweeted : " Always tougher when your ( sic ) in the minority ! ! # colour # race " . The tweet has now been deleted . Scotland released a statement confirming that Haq has been sent home and added that more information will not be divulged at the moment . The statement read : " Following a breach of Cricket Scotland 's internal code of conduct , international team member Majid Haq is travelling home from the ICC World Cup. No further statement will be issued until this process has been completed in due course. " Haq has represented the Scotland team during the side 's first four games , taking a total of three wickets. He has also failed to do well with the bat , having notched up a high score of 31 against Afghanistan , sparking his drop from the side for the game against Sri Lanka . Haq is Scotland 's most capped player , having donned the Scottish colours for more than 200 games. he has played in 60 ODIs , but could well have played his last in this World Cup following his ill-advised tweet suggesting he was dropped because of his race and colour . Having failed to notch up a single win in this WC , Scotland play their final Pool A game against Australia on Saturday . © Cricbuzz
