1989/90 - 1997/98 Profile A well-built brisk medium-pacer , Chris Pringle had one of the most remarkable introductions into international cricket. After one season of first-class cricket in the Shell Trophy - totalling six matches - Pringle was playing club cricket in England when he ambled over to the New Zealand side during a practice session at Headingley and asked if anyone had a spare ticket for the forthcoming ODI.

He started his Test career on a high , with 11 for 152 in his third match ( including 7 for 52 in the first innings ) against Pakistan at Faisalabad , although he later admitted that he had tampered with the ball because he was sure Pakistan were doing it .
