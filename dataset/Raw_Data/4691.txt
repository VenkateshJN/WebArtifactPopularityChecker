Arjun Bhardwaj , 24 , now wants New Zealand to win the cricket World Cup , according to a report in 'New Zealand Herald' . The reason being is that Bhardwaj took a clean one-handed catch during a Pool B match between India and Zimbabwe at Auckland 's Eden Park on Saturday , which made him the sixth person to make the draw in the 'Tui Catch a Million ' competition , and he currently has a share of NZD 350,000 ( nearly $ 260,000 ) . The current prize pool of NZD 350,000 would be increased to 500,000 if New Zealand win their quarterfinal clash against the West Indies. It would subsequently be raised to 750,000 if the Black Caps make it to the final and to NZD 1 million if they lift the trophy . The booty would be shared between fans taking clean one-handed catches at any of the World Cup matches held in New Zealand , brewery brand Tui said on its website . Fans have to wear a special Tui 2015 'Catch a Million ' tee-shirt to participate in the competition . Bhardwaj , who moved to Auckland seven years ago from India , said that he planned to start a business with the money and was " very , very excited " .
