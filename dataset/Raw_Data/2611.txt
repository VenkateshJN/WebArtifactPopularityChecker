Under pressure Alastair Cook on the burner The author has posted comments on this article TNN | Jul 22 , 2014 , 10.11AM IST Cook is under severe pressure to either perform or leave the scene for someone else to do the job. ( Reuters Photo ) Page 1 of 4 England captain Alastair Cook , under severe pressure to either perform or leave the scene for someone else to do the job , spoke after the Lord 's Test . Excerpts : On captaincy : " If I 'm not scoring runs by the end of the series and losing more games , it becomes tougher and tougher does n't it. I 'm clearly maybe not the man to turn it around. I 've been speaking to Mooresy ( coach Peter Moores ) over the past couple of days me and him still think we can turn it around. " On India 's performance : " It 's a tough defeat. I think we have to give India a lot of credit. They have out bowled and out batted us. Last innings as well , the pitch was turning and bouncing , good toss to win. Credit to India , they left very well. " On what his team needs to do : " A lot of our performances have been by the younger guys , that 's good for English cricket. The older guys are not playing as well as their records suggest , same for myself , I have to start scoring runs as well. I 'm trying my heart out to turn this around. First and foremost , I have to start scoring runs. Recent past has n't been kind to me but we have won some games as captain as well.
