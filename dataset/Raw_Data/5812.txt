KXIP overcome record stand to beat MI Sun , Apr 12 2015 Last updated on Sunday , 12 April , 2015 , 07 : 18 PM Harbhajan Singh threw a big scare into Kings XI Punjab. © BCCI Kings XI Punjab overcame a record 100-run stand between Harbhajan Singh and debutant Jagadeesha Suchith to beat Mumbai Indians by 18 runs in match seven of IPL 2015 at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday night . MI captain Rohit Sharma 's decision to bowl first backfired as the KXIP bowlers , especially their seamers led by Mitchell Johnson , got a lot of movement off the pitch early into the second half of the match , and when the home team was reduced to 17 for 3 inside six overs in pursuit of 178 it was all over bar the shouting. Harbhajan ( 64 off 24 balls ) and Suchith ( 34 * off 20 balls ) played some audacious strokes towards the end to bring the crowd to its feet but their record partnership for the seventh wicket off 37 balls was n't enough to change what was inevitable after a top-order failure . The architect of the KXIP 's first win this season was George Bailey whose maiden IPL fifty ( 61 * off 32 balls ) had helped the team recover from a mini-collapse that saw last year 's runners-up reduced to 88 for 3 from a strong position of 60 for 0 . Harbhajan and Suchith were also responsible for keeping KXIP at least 20 runs short of what they would have liked on a pitch holding no demons. Openers Virender Sehwag and Murali Vijay tore into the bowling after Rohit 's blunder at the toss. Fast bowlers Vinay Kumar , Pawan Suyal and Lasith Malinga failed to make any impact as the KXIP duo raced to 57 for 0 in six overs. Sehwag was particularly impressive , picking out the gaps with ease just like he did in his heyday . With nothing going MI 's way , Rohit turned to Harbhajan and the offspinner did n't disappoint him , luring Sehwag ( 36 ) out of the crease to hit an easy skier to Kieron Pollard at long-on. Left-arm spinner Suchith then got his IPL career off to a great start in the next over with the wicket of the dangerous Glenn Maxwell , whose over-aggression once again hampered him from getting a big innings . After another excellent Harbhajan over accounted for Vijay ( 35 ) , the KXIP innings was brought back on track by a 46-run stand between David Miller and Bailey. However , just when the partnership threatened to push MI back into troubled waters , Malinga had Miller caught behind for 24. Looking at the situation , Bailey batted responsibly till the end and made sure his bowlers had a decent total to bowl at . If it were n't for MI 's top-order abject failure , the result could have been different. Johnson , Axar Patel and Anureet Singh picked up two wickets apiece , while Sandeep Sharma chipped in with one wicket to eventually succeed in helping their team move on from the defeat in their opening match against Rajasthan Royals . Brief scores : Kings XI Punjab 177/5 in 20 overs ( Bailey 61 * , Sehwag 36 , Vijay 35 , Miller 24 ; Habhajan 2/20 , Malinga 2/34 , Suchith 1/41 ) beat Mumbai Indians 159 for 7 ( Harbhajan 64 , Suchith 34 * ; Johnson 2/23 , Patel 2/30 , Anureet 2/41 ) by 18 runs © Cricbuzz Tags
