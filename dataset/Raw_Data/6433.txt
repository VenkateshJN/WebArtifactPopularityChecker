There is so much potential young talent in the country with which to work for the future. And above all one can not start picking players on either their distant past or their last score alone or there will never be a settled forward-looking team. Just drop the matter for the sake of the players of tomorrow . yorkshire-86 on March 13 , 2015 , 11 : 00 GMT We need our best players playing. That means returns for KP , Trott , Tredwell , Rashid and Onions , and the end of the line for Broad , Ali , Ballance , Cook , Stokes and Woakes . Junaid | 108470961973009219157 on March 13 , 2015 , 9 : 27 GMT For sure. If England have to come hard for next time should get KP back and as a Captain of England side and i bet u @ ECB that you will see sme leadership fighting from front. Cuz KP is made for bigger challanges . Popular Videos
